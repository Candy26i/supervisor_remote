Problem:
Is CA72-4 a useful biomarker in differential diagnosis between ovarian endometrioma and epithelial ovarian cancer?

Context:
Surgical excision of ovarian endometriomas in patients desiring pregnancy has recently been criticized because of the risk of damage to healthy ovarian tissue and consequent reduction of ovarian reserve. A correct diagnosis in cases not scheduled for surgery is therefore mandatory in order to avoid unexpected ovarian cancer misdiagnosis. Endometriosis is often associated with high levels of CA125. This marker is therefore not useful for discriminating ovarian endometrioma from ovarian malignancy. The aim of this study was to establish if the serum marker CA72-4 could be helpful in the differential diagnosis between ovarian endometriosis and epithelial ovarian cancer. Serums CA125 and CA72-4 were measured in 72 patients with ovarian endometriomas and 55 patients with ovarian cancer. High CA125 concentrations were observed in patients with ovarian endometriosis and in those with ovarian cancer. A marked difference in CA72-4 values was observed between women with ovarian cancer (71.0%) and patients with endometriosis (13.8%) (P<0.0001).

Problem:
Is the probability of prenatal diagnosis or termination of pregnancy different for fetuses with congenital anomalies conceived following assisted reproductive techniques?

Context:
To compare the probability of prenatal diagnosis (PND) and termination of pregnancy for fetal anomaly (TOPFA) between fetuses conceived by assisted reproductive techniques (ART) and spontaneously-conceived fetuses with congenital heart defects (CHD). Population-based observational study. Paris and surrounding suburbs. Fetuses with CHD in the Paris registry of congenital malformations and cohort of children with CHD (Epicard). Comparison of ART-conceived and spontaneously conceived fetuses taking into account potential confounders (maternal characteristics, multiplicity and year of birth or TOPFA). Probability and gestational age at PND and TOPFA for ART-conceived versus spontaneously conceived fetuses. The probability of PND (28.1% versus 34.6%, P = 0.077) and TOPFA (36.2% versus 39.2%, P = 0.677) were not statistically different between ART-conceived (n = 171) and spontaneously conceived (n = 4620) fetuses. Estimates were similar after adjustment for potential confounders. Gestational age at PND tended to be earlier for ART fetuses (23.1 versus 24.8 weeks, P = 0.05) but no statistical difference was found after adjustment for confounders. Gestational age at TOPFA was comparable between ART-conceived and spontaneously conceived fetuses.

Problem:
Assessing Patient Reported Outcomes Measures via Phone Interviews Versus Patient Self-Survey in the Clinic: Are We Measuring the Same Thing?

Context:
Longitudinally following patients requires a full-time employee (FTE)-dependent data inflow infrastructure. There are efforts to capture patient-reported outcomes (PROs) by the use of non-FTE-dependent methodologies. In this study, we set out to assess the reliability of PRO data captured via FTE-dependent compared with non-FTE-dependent methodologies. A total of 119 adult patients (65 men) who underwent 1-and 2-level lumbar fusions at Duke University Medical Center were enrolled in this prospective study. Enrollment criteria included available demographic, clinical, and PRO data. All patients completed 2 sets of questionnaires--the first a phone interviews and the second a self-survey. There was at least a 2-week period between the phone interviews and self-survey. Questionnaires included the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), the visual analog scale for back pain (VAS-BP), and the visual analog scale for leg pain (VAS-LP). Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare the reliability of baseline PRO data captured. A total of 39.49% of patients were smokers, 21.00% had diabetes, and 11.76% had coronary artery disease; 26.89% reported history of anxiety disorder, and 28.57% reported history of depression. A total of 97.47% of patients had a high-school diploma or General Education Development, and 49.57% attained a 4-year college degree or postgraduate degree. We observed a high correlation between baseline PRO data captured between FTE-dependent versus non-FTE dependent methodologies (ODI: r = -0.89, VAS-BP: r = 0.74, VAS-LP: r = 0.70). There was no difference in PROs of baseline pain and functional disability between FTE-dependent and non-FTE-dependent methodologies: baseline ODI (FTE-dependent: 47.73 ± 16.77 [mean ± SD] vs. non-FTE-dependent: 45.81 ± 12.11, P = 0.39), VAS-LP (FTE-dependent: 6.13 ± 2.78 vs. non-FTE-dependent: 6.46 ± 2.79, P = 0.36) and VAS-BP (FTE-dependent: 6.33 ± 2.90 vs. non-FTE-dependent: 6.53 ± 2.48, P = 0.57).

Problem:
Is low serum chloride level a risk factor for cardiovascular mortality?

Context:
Serum chloride level is routinely assayed in clinical laboratories in the management of patients with kidney disorders and with metabolic diseases. It is a biological parameter that is easily, precisely and relatively cheaply measured. The epidemiological features of serum chloride levels have not been studied before. For the random sample of men and women from the Belgian Interuniversity Research on Nutrition and Health aged 25-74 years, free of symptomatic coronary heart disease at baseline, serum chloride concentrations were measured, among those of other electrolytes. The cohort was followed up for 10 years with respect to subsequent cause-specific mortality. The results are based on observations of 4793 men and 4313 women. According to Cox regression analysis serum chloride level was one of the strongest predictors of total, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and non-CVD mortalities independently of age, body mass index, sex, smoking, systolic blood pressure, levels of total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, uric acid, serum creatinine and serum total proteins and intake of diuretics. This relation was proved to be independent of levels of other serum electrolytes and similar for men and women. The estimated adjusted risk ratio for CVD death for subjects with a serum chloride level<or =100 mmol/l compared with those with levels above that limit was 1.65 (95% confidence interval 1.06-2.57) for men and 2.16 (95% confidence interval 1.11-4.22) for women. The study of adjusted risk ratios for four groups of subjects defined on the basis of their baseline serum chloride levels revealed a decreasing log-linear 'dose-response' relation to total and cardiovascular mortalities.

<answer>Analysis of the context and key facts
The context provides information about a study involving a large cohort of men and women from Belgium who were followed up over 10 years. The study aimed to determine if serum chloride levels are associated with cardiovascular mortality. Key findings include:

- Serum chloride level was identified as one of the strongest predictors of total, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and non-CVD mortalities.
- There is an inverse relationship between serum chloride levels and the risk of CVD mortality. Specifically, individuals with serum chloride levels ≤100 mmol/L had significantly increased risks of CVD death, with adjusted risk ratios of 1.65 for men and 2.16 for women.
- The relation was independent of several confounding factors such as age, body mass index, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and use of diuretics.
- A log-linear dose-response relationship was observed between serum chloride levels and total and cardiovascular mortalities.

There is no direct contradiction within the context provided.
</answer>Answer: yes

The context clearly demonstrates that low serum chloride levels are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. Therefore, based on this evidence, the answer

Problem:
Traumatic aortic injury: does the anatomy of the aortic arch influence aortic trauma severity?

Context:
Traumatic aortic injury (TAI) is a rare but life-threatening type of injury. We investigate whether the anatomy of the aortic arch influences the severity of aortic injury. This is a retrospective study of twenty-two cases treated with TEVAR for TAI in our department from 2009 to 2014. Aortic injury was assessed in accordance with the recommendations of the Society of Vascular Surgery. We measured the aortic arch angle and the aortic arch index, based on the initial angio-CT scan, in each of the analyzed cases. The mean aortic arch index and mean aortic arch angle were 6.8 cm and 58.3°, respectively, in the type I injury group; 4.4 cm and 45.9° in the type III group; 3.3 cm and 37° in the type IV group. There were substantial differences in both the aortic arch index and the aortic arch angle of the type III and IV groups. A multivariate analysis confirmed that the aortic arch angle was significantly associated with the occurrence of type III damage (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.03-2.2).

<analysis>
The context discusses a study investigating whether the anatomy of the aortic arch influences the severity of traumatic aortic injuries (TAI). Key points include:

- The study involved 22 cases of TAI treated with thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) between 2009 and 2014.
- Aortic injuries were classified according to the Society of Vascular Surgery's recommendations.
- The aortic arch angle and aortic arch index were measured using initial angio-CT scans.
- Differences were noted in the aortic arch index and angle among different injury types (type I, III, and IV).
- A multivariate analysis found that the aortic arch angle was significantly associated with the occurrence of type III damage, indicating a relationship between arch angle and severity.

These findings suggest that the anatomical characteristics of the aortic arch, particularly its angle, may play a role in the severity of TAI.

Problem:
Is severe macrosomia manifested at 11-14 weeks of gestation?

Context:
To determine the association between fetal biometry in the first or early second trimester and severe macrosomia at delivery. This case-control study included 30 term severely macrosomic neonates; 90 appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) neonates served as controls. All pregnancies underwent nuchal translucency (NT) screening at 11-14 weeks' gestation. Pregnancies were dated by accurate last menstrual period consistent with crown-rump length (CRL) measurements at the time of screening, early pregnancy CRL or date of fertilization. The association between birth weight and the difference between the measured and the expected CRL at the time of NT screening was analyzed. The difference between measured and expected CRL, expressed both in mm and in days of gestation, was statistically greater in the severely macrosomic neonates compared with controls (mean, 6.66 +/- 4.78 mm vs. 1.17 +/- 4.6 mm, P<0.0001 and 3 +/- 2.2 days vs. 0.5 +/- 2.3 days, P<0.0001, respectively). Furthermore, there were significant correlations between the extent of macrosomia and the discrepancy between expected and measured fetal size at the time of NT screening (r = 0.47, P<0.01 and r = 0.48, P<0.01, respectively).

Problem:
Is arch form influenced by sagittal molar relationship or Bolton tooth-size discrepancy?

Context:
Orthodontic patients show high prevalence of tooth-size discrepancy. This study investigates the possible association between arch form, clinically significant tooth-size discrepancy, and sagittal molar relationship. Pretreatment orthodontic casts of 230 Saudi patients were classified into one of three arch form types (tapered, ovoid, and square) using digitally scanned images of the mandibular arches. Bolton ratio was calculated, sagittal molar relationship was defined according to Angle classification, and correlations were analyzed using ANOVA, chi-square, and t-tests. No single arch form was significantly more common than the others. Furthermore, no association was observed between the presence of significant Bolton discrepancy and the sagittal molar relationship or arch form. Overall Bolton discrepancy is significantly more prevalent in males.

Problem:
Is oral endotracheal intubation efficacy impaired in the helicopter environment?

Context:
Patients transported by helicopter often require advanced airway management. The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not the in-flight environment of air medical transport in a BO-105 helicopter impairs the ability of flight nurses to perform oral endotracheal intubation. The study was conducted in an MBB BO-105 helicopter. Flight nurses performed three manikin intubations in each of the two study environments: on an emergency department stretcher and in-flight in the BO-105 helicopter. The mean time required for in-flight intubation (25.9 +/- 10.9 seconds) was significantly longer than the corresponding time (13.2 +/- 2.8 seconds) required for intubation in the control setting (ANOVA, F = 38.7, p<.001). All intubations performed in the control setting were placed correctly in the trachea; there were two (6.7%) esophageal intubations in the in-flight setting. The difference in appropriate endotracheal intubation between the two settings was not significant (chi 2 = 0.3; p>0.05).

Follow the specified XML output strictly. Do not include any additional explanation.

<analysis>
The context discusses a study comparing the ability of flight nurses to perform oral endotracheal intubation in two settings: on an emergency department stretcher and in-flight in a BO-105 helicopter. Key findings include:
1. In-flight intubation took significantly longer (mean time 25.9 +/- 10.9 seconds) compared to the control setting (mean time 13.2 +/- 2.8 seconds).
2. There were no statistically significant differences in the rate of appropriate endotracheal intubations between the two settings (chi 2 = 0.3; p>0.05).
The study specifically examined the impact of the helicopter environment on intubation efficacy, focusing on time taken and the frequency of successful intubation.

Problem:
Is an advance care planning model feasible in community palliative care?

Context:
An effective advance care planning programme involves an organizational wide commitment and preparedness for health service reform to embed advance care planning into routine practice. Internationally, such programmes have been implemented predominantly in aged and acute care with more recent work in primary care. A multi-site action research was conducted over a 16-month period in 2007-2009 with three Victorian community palliative care services. Using mixed method data collection strategies to assess feasibility, we conducted a baseline audit of staff and clients; analysed relevant documents (client records, policies, procedures and quality improvement strategies) pre-implementation and post-implementation and conducted key informant interviews (n = 9). Three community palliative care services: one regional and two metropolitan services in Victoria, Australia. The services demonstrated that it was feasible to embed the Model into their organizational structures. Advance care planning conversations and involvement of family was an important outcome measure rather than completion rate of advance care planning documents in community settings. Services adapted and applied their own concept of community, which widened the impact of the model. Changes to quality audit processes were essential to consolidate the model into routine palliative care practice.

Problem:
Can the growth rate of a gallbladder polyp predict a neoplastic polyp?

Context:
Cholecystectomy for GB polyps that are larger than 10 mm is generally recommended because of the high probability of neoplasm. In contrast, a follow-up strategy is preferred for GB polyps smaller than 10 mm. However, there are no treatment guidelines for polyps that grow in size during the follow-up period.STUDY: We retrospectively investigated 145 patients with GB polyps who underwent at least 1 ultrasonographic follow-up examination over an interval greater than 6 months, before cholecystectomy at Samsung medical center, South Korea, from 1994 to 2007. The growth rate was determined based on the change in size per time interval between 2 ultrasonographic examinations (mm/mo). The median age of the patients was 48 years (range: 25 to 75). One hundred twenty-five non-neoplastic polyps and 20 neoplastic polyps were found. Neoplastic polyps were more frequently found in patients older than 60 years, those with hypertension, a polyp size greater than 10 mm, and a rapid growth rate greater than 0.6 mm/mo. On multivariate analysis, however, the growth rate was not related to the neoplastic nature of a polyp, but older age (>60 y) and large size (>10 mm) were significantly associated with neoplastic polyps.

Problem:
SPECT study with I-123-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) in patients with essential tremor. Is there any correlation with Parkinson's disease?

Context:
The differential diagnosis between essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD) may be, in some cases, very difficult on clinical grounds alone. In addition, it is accepted that a small percentage of ET patients presenting symptoms and signs of possible PD may progress finally to a typical pattern of parkinsonism. Ioflupane, N-u-fluoropropyl-2a-carbomethoxy-3a-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane, also called FP-CIT, labelled with (123)I (commercially known as DaTSCAN) has been proven to be useful in the differential diagnosis between PD and ET and to confirm dopaminergic degeneration in patients with parkinsonism. The aim of this study is to identify dopaminergic degeneration in patients with PD and distinguish them from others with ET using semi-quantitative SPECT (123)I-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) data in comparison with normal volunteers (NV), in addition with the respective ones of patients referred as suffering from ET, as well as, of patients with a PD diagnosis at an initial stage with a unilateral presentation of motor signs. Twenty-eight patients suffering from ET (10 males plus 18 females) and 28 NV (12 males and 16 females) were enroled in this study. In addition, 33 patients (11 males and 22 females) with an established diagnosis of PD with unilateral limb involvement (12 left hemi-body and 21 right hemi-body) were included for comparison with ET. We used DaTSCAN to obtain SPECT images and measure the radiopharmaceutical uptake in the striatum (S), as well as the caudate nucleus (CN) and putamen (P) in all individuals. Qualitative (Visual) interpretation of the SPECT data did not find any difference in the uptake of the radiopharmaceutical at the level of the S, CN and P between NV and ET patients. Reduced accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical uptake was found in the P of all PD patients. Semiquantitative analysis revealed significant differences between NV and ET patients in the striatum, reduced in the latter. There was also a significant reduction in the tracer accumulation in the left putamen of patients with right hemi-parkinsonism compared to ET and NV. Patients with left hemi-parkinsonism, demonstrated reduced radioligand uptake in the right putamen in comparison with ET and NV. Clinical follow-up of 20 patients with ET at (so many months afterwards) revealed no significant change in clinical presentation, particularly no signs of PD. Follow-up DaTSCAN performed in 10 of them (so many months afterwards) was negative in all but one. This one had an equivocal baseline study which deteriorated 12 months later.

Problem:
Does the bracket-ligature combination affect the amount of orthodontic space closure over three months?

Context:
To investigate the effect of bracket-ligature combination on the amount of orthodontic space closure over three months. Randomized clinical trial with three parallel groups. A hospital orthodontic department (Chesterfield Royal Hospital, UK). Forty-five patients requiring upper first premolar extractions. Informed consent was obtained and participants were randomly allocated into one of three groups: (1) conventional pre-adjusted edgewise brackets and elastomeric ligatures; (2) conventional pre-adjusted edgewise brackets and Super Slick(®) low friction elastomeric ligatures; (3) Damon 3MX(®) passive self-ligating brackets. Space closure was undertaken on 0·019×0·025-inch stainless steel archwires with nickel-titanium coil springs. Participants were recalled at four weekly intervals. Upper alginate impressions were taken at each visit (maximum three). The primary outcome measure was the mean amount of space closure in a 3-month period. A one-way ANOVA was undertaken [dependent variable: mean space closure (mm); independent variable: group allocation]. The amount of space closure was very similar between the three groups (1 mm per 28 days); however, there was a wide variation in the rate of space closure between individuals. The differences in the amount of space closure over three months between the three groups was very small and non-significant (P = 0·718).

Problem:
Do viral infections have a role in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo?

Context:
To investigate the role of viral infection in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). In this retrospective study, 483 patients with BPPV were included in the study group. The control group consisted of 461 healthy subjects. In both groups, serologic analysis of viral agents (HSV1, HSV2, Herpes zoster, EBV, CMV, adenovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza virus) was performed. With the exception of influenza and parainfluenza, all viral serology values were higher in the BBPV group than the control group. We also observed seasonal variation. The BPPV group exhibited elevated values for HSV1 and adenovirus in March and May, for Herpes zoster, adenovirus, and influenza in April, for HSV1 in June, and for HSV1 and CMV in September, compared to the control group. In October, the BPPV group showed increased values for all of the viruses studied, compared to the control group.

<analysis>
Key facts extracted from the context:
1. A retrospective study included 483 patients with BPPV and 461 healthy controls.
2. Serological analysis of various viral agents was conducted in both groups.
3. Except for influenza and parainfluenza, all viral serology values were higher in the BPPV group.
4. Seasonal variations were noted where specific viral serology values were higher in certain months for the BPPV group compared to the control group.
5. Notably, in October, all studied viral serology values were elevated in the BPPV group.

Contradictions or limitations:
- The study is retrospective, which limits the ability to establish causality between viral infections and BPPV.
- No direct causal relationship between viral infections and BPPV can be inferred solely from these results.
- The presence of elevated viral serologies does not necessarily mean that these viruses caused the BPPV.

Relevance to the question:
The context provides evidence suggesting a possible association between certain viral infections and the occurrence of BPPV, particularly during certain seasons and specifically mentioning increased levels of HSV1, adenovirus, Herpes zoster, and CMV in October.

Problem:
Do improvements in outreach, clinical, and family and community-based services predict improvements in child survival?

Context:
There are three main service delivery channels: clinical services, outreach, and family and community. To determine which delivery channels are associated with the greatest reductions in under-5 mortality rates (U5MR), we used data from sequential population-based surveys to examine the correlation between changes in coverage of clinical, outreach, and family and community services and in U5MR for 27 high-burden countries. Household survey data were abstracted from serial surveys in 27 countries. Average annual changes (AAC) between the most recent and penultimate survey were calculated for under-five mortality rates and for 22 variables in the domains of clinical, outreach, and family- and community-based services. For all 27 countries and a subset of 19 African countries, we conducted principal component analysis to reduce the variables into a few components in each domain and applied linear regression to assess the correlation between changes in the principal components and changes in under-five mortality rates after controlling for multiple potential confounding factors. AAC in under 5-mortality varied from 6.6% in Nepal to -0.9% in Kenya, with six of the 19 African countries all experiencing less than a 1% decline in mortality. The strongest correlation with reductions in U5MR was observed for access to clinical services (all countries: p = 0.02, r² = 0.58; 19 African countries p<0.001, r² = 0.67). For outreach activities, AAC U5MR was significantly correlated with antenatal care and family planning services, while AAC in immunization services showed no association. In the family- and community services domain, improvements in breastfeeding were associated with significant changes in mortality in the 30 countries but not in the African subset; while in the African countries, nutritional status improvements were associated with a significant decline in mortality.

<xml>
<analysis>
In the provided context, the analysis focuses on the relationship between changes in various types of services (clinical, outreach, and family/community-based) and reductions in under-5 mortality rates across 27 high-burden countries. Key points extracted include:

1. Data from household surveys in 27 countries were analyzed to correlate changes in service coverage with under-5 mortality rates.
2. Principal component analysis was used to reduce the variables into more manageable components within each service domain.
3. Linear regression was applied to assess the correlation between changes in these components and changes in under-5 mortality rates, adjusting for potential confounders.
4. For all countries, the strongest correlation with reductions in under-5 mortality rates was found for access to clinical services.
5. Correlations for outreach services were noted specifically for antenatal care and family planning services.
6. Improvements in breastfeeding within family/community services correlated with mortality reductions in 30 countries, but not in the African subset.
7. Nutritional status improvements were associated with significant declines in mortality in the African countries only.

Problem:
30-Day and 1-year mortality in emergency general surgery laparotomies: an area of concern and need for improvement?

Context:
Emergency surgery is associated with poorer outcomes and higher mortality with recent studies suggesting the 30-day mortality to be 14-15%. The aim of this study was to analyse the 30-day mortality, age-related 30-day mortality and 1-year mortality following emergency laparotomy. We hope this will encourage prospective data collection, improvement of care and initiate strategies to establish best practice in this area. This was a retrospective study of patients who underwent emergency laparotomy from June 2010 to May 2012. The primary end point of the study was 30-day mortality, age-related 30-day mortality and 1-year all-cause mortality. 477 laparotomies were performed in 446 patients. 57% were aged<70 and 43% aged>70 years. 30-day mortality was 12, 4% in those aged<70 years and 22% in those>70 years (p<0.001). 1-year mortality was 25, 15% in those aged under 70 years and 38% in those aged>70 years (p<0.001).

Problem:
Do older patients who refuse to participate in a self-management intervention in the Netherlands differ from older patients who agree to participate?

Context:
Refusal of patients to participate in intervention programs is an important problem in clinical trials but, in general, researchers devote relatively little attention to it. In this article, a comparison is made between patients who, after having been invited, agreed to participate in a self-management intervention (participants) and those who refused (refusers). Compared with other studies of refusers, relatively more information could be gathered with regard to both their characteristics and reasons for refusing, because all potential participants were invited personally. Older patients from a Dutch outpatient clinic were invited to participate in a self-management intervention, and their characteristics were assessed. Demographic data were collected, as well as data on physical functioning and lack of emotional support. People who refused to participate were asked to give their reasons for refusing. Of the 361 patients invited, 267 (74%) refused participation. These refusers were more restricted in their mobility, lived further away from the location of the intervention, and had a partner more often than did the participants. No differences were found in level of education, age or gender. The main reasons given by respondents for refusing to participate were lack of time, travel distance, and transport problems.

Problem:
Is it better to be big?

Context:
Swedish hospital mergers seem to stem from a conviction among policy makers that bigger hospitals lead to lower average costs and improved clinical outcomes. The effects of mergers in the form of multisited hospitals have not been systematically evaluated. The purpose of this article is to contribute to this area of knowledge by exploring responses to the merger of Blekinge Hospital. The evaluation was guided by the philosophy of triangulation. A questionnaire was sent to 597 randomly selected employees, that is 24% of the health care staff. Four hundred ninety-eight employees answered the questionnaire, giving a response rate of 83%. Furthermore, interviews of different groups of stakeholders were conducted. A moderate increase of quality was assessed, which, a low proportion of the employees perceived had decisively or largely to do with the merger. The majority perceives economical incentives as the drivers of change, but, at the same time, only 10% of this group believes this target was reached completely or to a large extent.

<xml>
<reasoning>Rationale for the answer:
The context discusses a study on the merger of Blekinge Hospital and its impact on quality and cost. While there was a moderate increase in quality, only 24% of the health care staff responded positively to the merger, and 10% believed that cost targets were fully met. This indicates that while merging may aim to improve efficiency and reduce costs, the actual outcomes may vary and are subject to subjective evaluation.
Given these findings, the statement "it is better to be big" cannot be universally affirmed without considering the specific context and potential downsides such as employee satisfaction and cost targets not being met.</reasoning>

<reasoning>Rationale for the answer:
The context highlights the Swedish hospital mergers where policymakers believe larger hospitals can achieve lower average costs and improved clinical outcomes. However, the study on Blekinge Hospital showed a moderate increase in quality and only 24% of employees perceived a significant improvement due to the merger. Additionally, the cost targets were only met by 10% of the group, suggesting that while scale can offer potential benefits, they may not always be realized in

Problem:
Sternal plating for primary and secondary sternal closure; can it improve sternal stability?

Context:
Sternal instability with mediastinitis is a very serious complication after median sternotomy. Biomechanical studies have suggested superiority of rigid plate fixation over wire cerclage for sternal fixation. This study tests the hypothesis that sternal closure stability can be improved by adding plate fixation in a human cadaver model. Midline sternotomy was performed in 18 human cadavers. Four sternal closure techniques were tested: (1) approximation with six interrupted steel wires; (2) approximation with six interrupted cables; (3) closure 1 (wires) or 2 (cables) reinforced with a transverse sternal plate at the sixth rib; (4) Closure using 4 sternal plates alone. Intrathoracic pressure was increased in all techniques while sternal separation was measured by three pairs of sonomicrometry crystals fixed at the upper, middle and lower parts of the sternum until 2.0 mm separation was detected. Differences in displacement pressures were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and Regression Coefficients. Intrathoracic pressure required to cause 2.0 mm separation increased significantly from 183.3 +/- 123.9 to 301.4 +/- 204.5 in wires/cables alone vs. wires/cables plus one plate respectively, and to 355.0 +/- 210.4 in the 4 plates group (p<0.05). Regression Coefficients (95% CI) were 120 (47-194) and 142 (66-219) respectively for the plate groups.

Follow the specified XML output strictly. Do not deviate from the format.

<analysis>
The context describes a study comparing different sternal closure methods using a human cadaver model to assess sternal stability. The study found that adding sternal plates to either wires or cables significantly improved the sternal closure stability compared to using wires or cables alone. The intrathoracic pressure required to cause 2.0 mm separation was notably higher when sternal plates were used, suggesting improved sternal stability.
Key facts:
1. The study involved 18 human cadavers.
2. Four sternal closure techniques were tested.
3. The addition of sternal plates (both single and multiple) significantly increased the pressure required to achieve sternal separation compared to using wires or cables alone.
4. Sternal plate fixation showed superior stability compared to wire cerclage.
Contradictions:
There are no apparent contradictions within the provided context.
Relevance to the question:
The context directly addresses the question by providing evidence that sternal plate fixation can improve sternal stability compared to other closure techniques.
</analysis>
Answer: yes

The analysis clearly shows that sternal plate fixation improves sternal stability, which directly answers the question affirmatively. Answer: yes

Problem:
Is there a relationship between homocysteine and vitiligo?

Context:
Pigmentary dilution is observed in patients with homocystinuria. Therefore, it is possible that an increase of local homocysteine (Hcy) interferes with normal melanogenesis and plays a role in the pathogenesis of vitiligo. Vitamin B12 and folic acid, levels of which are decreased in vitiligo, are important cofactors in the metabolism of Hcy. Consequently, a nutritional deficiency in either of these two vitamins will result in an increase in homocysteine in the circulation, a finding that we expect to find in vitiligo. To determine the level of Hcy in the blood of patients with vitiligo as a first step in revealing if it has any relationship with the pathogenesis of vitiligo and consequently if this will have an impact on the treatment of vitiligo. Twenty-six patients of both sexes with vitiligo (age range 20-50 years, mean 31.4 +/- 8.09) and 26 age-matched healthy controls were included in the study. After excluding factors that may affect serum Hcy levels, blood samples from patients and controls were obtained for homocysteine determination by enzyme immunoassay. The mean serum level of Hcy was significantly higher in patients with vitiligo than in controls (21.61 +/- 13.28 vs. 13.1 +/- 4.88 micromol L(-1); P<0.001). The Hcy level was significantly higher in male patients than in female patients (28.67 +/- 15.95 vs. 15.56 +/- 6.2 micromol L(-1); P<0.001) and in male controls compared with female controls (15.07 +/- 4.61 vs. 12.05 +/- 4.82 micromol L(-1); P<0.001). The homocysteine level was related to the activity of vitiligo and was significantly higher in patients with progressive disease than in controls (25.4 +/- 14.99 vs. 13.1 +/- 4.88 micromol L(-1); P<0.001). No significant difference in Hcy levels was found between either untreated vitiligo patients (22.77 +/- 13.36 micromol L(-1)) or patients receiving ultraviolet therapy (20.45 +/- 13.73 micromol L(-1)) and the total patient group (21.62 +/- 13.28 micromol L(-1)).

<answer>
<analysis>
The context presents evidence suggesting a relationship between homocysteine (Hcy) and vitiligo. Key points include:

1. **Observation**: Patients with homocystinuria show pigmentary dilution, which hints at a potential role of increased local Hcy in interfering with normal melanogenesis.
2. **Role of Nutrients**: Decreased levels of vitamin B12 and folic acid, important cofactors in Hcy metabolism, are observed in vitiligo patients. This suggests that nutritional deficiencies could lead to elevated Hcy levels.
3. **Study Findings**: A study comparing 26 vitiligo patients with 26 healthy controls found that the mean serum level of Hcy was significantly higher in vitiligo patients (21.61 +/- 13.28 micromol/L) compared to controls (13.1 +/- 4.88 micromol/L). This supports the hypothesis that Hcy levels might be elevated in vitiligo.
4. **Gender Differences**: Higher Hcy levels were observed in male patients (28.67 +/- 15.95 micromol/L) compared to female

Problem:
Does performance in selection processes predict performance as a dental student?

Context:
This study investigated associations between the performance of dental students in each of the three components of the selection procedure [academic average, Undergraduate Medicine and Health Sciences Admission Test (UMAT) and structured interview], socio-demographic characteristics and their academic success in an undergraduate dental surgery programme. Longitudinal review of admissions data relating to students entering dental education at the University of Otago, New Zealand, between 2004 and 2009 was compared with academic performance throughout the dental programme. After controlling for variables, pre-admission academic average, UMAT scores and interview performance did not predict performance as a dental student. Class place in second year, however, was a strong predictor of class place in final year. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the best predictors of higher class placement in the final year were New Zealand European ethnicity and domestic (rather than international) student status. Other socio-demographic characteristics were not associated with performance. These interim findings provide a sound base for the ongoing study.

Problem:
Does increased patient awareness improve accrual into cancer-related clinical trials?

Context:
Oncology literature cites that only 2% to 4% of patients participate in research. Up to 85% of patients are unaware that clinical trials research is being conducted at their treatment facility or that they might be eligible to participate. It was hypothesized that patients' satisfaction with information regarding clinical trials would improve after targeted educational interventions, and accruals to clinical trials would increase in the year following those interventions. All new patients referred to the cancer center over a 4-month period were mailed a baseline survey to assess their knowledge of clinical research. Subsequently, educational interventions were provided, including an orientation session highlighting clinical trials, a pamphlet, and a reference to a clinical trials Web site. A postintervention survey was sent to the responders of the initial survey 3 months after the initial mailing. Patient satisfaction with information significantly increased after the interventions. There was no increase in subsequent enrollment in clinical trials. Patients who indicated an inclination to participate in clinical trials tended to have greater satisfaction with the information they received.

Follow the specified XML output strictly. Do not deviate from the format.
<reasoning>Step-by-step reasoning combining question and context:

1. The initial context mentions that only 2% to 4% of patients participate in cancer-related clinical trials, indicating a low participation rate.
2. Up to 85% of patients are unaware that clinical trials are happening at their treatment facilities, suggesting that lack of awareness may contribute to the low participation rate.
3. An intervention was implemented, which included providing educational materials and conducting orientation sessions about clinical trials.
4. Patient satisfaction with the information about clinical trials significantly increased after these interventions.
5. Despite the increase in satisfaction, there was no observed increase in subsequent enrollment in clinical trials.
6. The context notes that patients who tend to be inclined towards participating in clinical trials already had higher satisfaction levels before the interventions.

From this analysis, while increased patient awareness through targeted educational interventions did lead to a significant increase in patient satisfaction, it did not directly translate to an increase in enrollment in clinical trials. This suggests that other factors besides awareness may be influencing patient decisions to participate in clinical trials.</reasoning>
Answer: maybe

The reasoning indicates that increased patient awareness can lead to higher satisfaction but does not necessarily result in higher enrollment rates in clinical trials. Other factors

Problem:
Did the call for boycott by the Catholic bishops affect the polio vaccination coverage in Kenya in 2015?

Context:
Polio eradication is now feasible after removal of Nigeria from the list of endemic countries and global reduction of cases of wild polio virus in 2015 by more than 80%. However, all countries must remain focused to achieve eradication. In August 2015, the Catholic bishops in Kenya called for boycott of a polio vaccination campaign citing safety concerns with the polio vaccine. We conducted a survey to establish if the coverage was affected by the boycott. A cross sectional survey was conducted in all the 32 counties that participated in the campaign. A total of 90,157 children and 37,732 parents/guardians were sampled to determine the vaccination coverage and reasons for missed vaccination. The national vaccination coverage was 93% compared to 94% in the November 2014 campaign. The proportion of parents/guardians that belonged to Catholic Church was 31% compared to 7% of the children who were missed. Reasons for missed vaccination included house not being visited (44%), children not being at home at time of visit (38%), refusal by parents (12%), children being as leep (1%), and various other reasons (5%). Compared to the November 2014 campaign, the proportion of children who were not vaccinated due to parent's refusal significantly increased from 6% to 12% in August 2015.

<analysis>From the given context, it can be seen that in August 2015, the Catholic bishops in Kenya called for a boycott of the polio vaccination campaign due to safety concerns. A survey was conducted across 32 counties in Kenya to assess the impact of this call for boycott on the vaccination coverage. The national vaccination coverage in August 2015 was reported as 93%, which was slightly lower than the 94% achieved in the November 2014 campaign. It was noted that the increase in the proportion of children not vaccinated due to parental refusal rose from 6% in November 2014 to 12% in August 2015, coinciding with the period when the boycott was called. However, other factors such as children not being at home or the visits not being made also contributed to the non-vaccination rates.</analysis>

Problem:
Does a history of unintended pregnancy lessen the likelihood of desire for sterilization reversal?

Context:
Unintended pregnancy has been significantly associated with subsequent female sterilization. Whether women who are sterilized after experiencing an unintended pregnancy are less likely to express desire for sterilization reversal is unknown. This study used national, cross-sectional data collected by the 2006-2010 National Survey of Family Growth. The study sample included women ages 15-44 who were surgically sterile from a tubal sterilization at the time of interview. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between a history of unintended pregnancy and desire for sterilization reversal while controlling for potential confounders. In this nationally representative sample of 1,418 women who were sterile from a tubal sterilization, 78% had a history of at least one unintended pregnancy and 28% expressed a desire to have their sterilization reversed. In unadjusted analysis, having a prior unintended pregnancy was associated with higher odds of expressing desire for sterilization reversal (odds ratio [OR]: 1.80; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15-2.79). In adjusted analysis controlling for sociodemographic factors, unintended pregnancy was no longer significantly associated with desire for reversal (OR: 1.46; 95% CI: 0.91-2.34).

Problem:
Is the zeolite hemostatic agent beneficial in reducing blood loss during arterial injury?

Context:
Uncontrolled hemorrhage is the leading cause of fatality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of zeolite mineral (QuikClot - Advanced Clotting Sponge [QC-ACS]) on blood loss and physiological variables in a swine extremity arterial injury model. Sixteen swine were used. Oblique groin incision was created and a 5 mm incision was made. The animals were allocated to: control group (n: 6): Pressure dressing was applied with manual pressure over gauze sponge; or QC group (n: 10): QC was directly applied over lacerated femoral artery. Mean arterial pressure, blood loss and physiological parameters were measured during the study period. Application of QC led to a slower drop in blood pressure. The control group had a significantly higher increase in lactate within 60 minutes. The mean prothrombin time in the control group was significantly increased at 60 minutes. The application of QC led to decreased total blood loss. The QC group had significantly higher hematocrit levels. QC application generated a significant heat production. There were mild edematous and vacuolar changes in nerve samples.

<analysis>
The context provides a detailed study evaluating the use of a zeolite-based hemostatic agent (QuikClot) on blood loss and physiological variables in a swine model of arterial injury. Key findings include:

- A control group using traditional pressure dressing (n=6).
- A test group using the zeolite hemostatic agent (QC, n=10).
- The zeolite hemostatic agent led to a slower drop in blood pressure and decreased total blood loss compared to the control group.
- The test group showed higher hematocrit levels, indicating better retention of red blood cells.
- The zeolite hemostatic agent generated significant heat production.
- Mild edematous and vacuolar changes in nerve samples were noted but do not appear to be related to the primary outcome of interest (reduction in blood loss).

The results suggest that the zeolite hemostatic agent may be beneficial in reducing blood loss and improving hemoglobin levels in cases of arterial injury, which could translate to better patient outcomes and potentially reduce the need for transfusions.

Problem:
Is there a role for endothelin-1 in the hemodynamic changes during hemodialysis?

Context:
The etiology of hemodialysis (HD)-induced hypotension and hypertension remains speculative. There is mounting evidence that endothelin-1 (ET-1) may play a vital role in these hemodynamic changes. We examined the possible role of intradialytic changes of ET-1 in the pathogenesis of hypotension and rebound hypertension during HD. The present study included 45 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on regular HD. They were divided according to their hemodynamic status during HD into three groups (group I had stable intradialytic hemodynamics, group II had dialysis-induced hypotension, and group III had rebound hypertension during HD). In addition, 15 healthy volunteers were included as a control group. Pulse and blood pressure were monitored before, during (every half hour), and after HD session. ET-1 level was measured at the beginning, middle, and end of HD. ET-1 was measured in the control group for comparison. Pre-dialysis levels of ET-1 were significantly higher in dialysis patients compared to the controls (P<0.001); however, they were comparable in the three HD groups. The post-dialysis ET-1 level was not changed significantly in group I compared with predialysis values (14.49 +/- 2.04 vs. 14.33 +/- 2.23 pg/ml; P = NS), while the ET-1 concentration decreased significantly in group II and increased in group III in comparison to predialysis values (8.56 +/- 1.44 vs. 11.75 +/- 2.51; 16.39 +/- 3.12 vs. 11.93 +/- 2.11 pg/ml, respectively; P<0.001).

<analysis>
The study examines the role of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in hemodynamic changes during hemodialysis (HD). Key facts include:

1. The study included 45 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing regular HD, divided into three groups based on their hemodynamic status during HD.
2. Pre-dialysis ET-1 levels were significantly higher in dialysis patients compared to healthy controls (P<0.001).
3. Post-dialysis ET-1 levels were not significantly different from pre-dialysis in the group with stable intradialytic hemodynamics (group I).
4. In the group experiencing dialysis-induced hypotension (group II), ET-1 concentrations decreased significantly post-dialysis.
5. In the group with rebound hypertension (group III), ET-1 concentrations increased significantly post-dialysis.
6. These findings suggest that ET-1 may play a role in the hemodynamic changes experienced during HD, particularly in the context of hypotension and rebound hypertension.

Problem:
Adults with mild intellectual disabilities: can their reading comprehension ability be improved?

Context:
Adults with a mild intellectual disability (ID) often show poor decoding and reading comprehension skills. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of teaching text comprehension strategies to these adults. Specific research goals were to determine (1) the effects of two instruction conditions, i.e. strategy instruction to individuals and strategy instruction in small groups in a reciprocal teaching context; (2) intervention programme effects on specific strategy tests (so-called direct effects), and possible differences between strategies; (3) (long-term) transfer effects of the programme on general reading comprehension ability; and (4) the regression of general text comprehension by the variables of technical reading, IQ, reading comprehension of sentences (RCS), and pretest and posttest scores on the strategies taught. In total, 38 adults (age range 20-72 years; mean age of 36 years) with ID participated in the study. IQs ranged from 45 to 69 with a mean IQ of 58. The intervention programme involved 15 weekly lessons of 1 h each, taught during 3 months. Blocks of lessons included each of Brown and Palincsar's strategies of summarizing, questioning, clarifying and predicting, as participants read and studied narrative and expository texts. Results indicated no significant difference between group and individual instruction conditions. Second, direct programme effects - as determined by posttest-pretest contrasts for strategy tests - were substantial, except for the questioning strategy. Third, even more substantial was the transfer effect to general text comprehension. Moreover, the results on this test were well maintained at a follow-up test. Finally, the variance of general reading comprehension ability was best explained by the test of RCS, and only moderately by the strategies trained.

Problem:
Could ADMA levels in young adults born preterm predict an early endothelial dysfunction?

Context:
Sporadic data present in literature report how preterm birth and low birth weight are risk factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases in later life. High levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), a strong inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis, are associated with the future development of adverse cardiovascular events and cardiac death. 1) to verify the presence of a statistically significant difference between ADMA levels in young adults born preterm at extremely low birth weight (<1000 g; ex-ELBW) and those of a control group of healthy adults born at term (C) and 2) to seek correlations between ADMA levels in ex-ELBW and anthropometric and clinical parameters (gender, chronological age, gestational age, birth weight, and duration of stay in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit). Thirty-two ex-ELBW subjects (11 males [M] and 21 females [F], aged 17-29years, mean age 22.2 ± 2.3 years) were compared with 25 C (7 M and 18F). ADMA levels were assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography with highly sensitive laser fluorescent detection. ADMA levels were reduced in ex-ELBW subjects compared to C (0.606+0.095 vs 0.562+0.101 μmol/L, p<0.05), and significantly correlated inversely with gestational age (r=-0.61, p<0.00001) and birth weight (r=-0.57, p<0.0002).

<analysis>
The study compares ADMA levels in young adults born preterm at extremely low birth weight (ex-ELBW) with a control group of healthy adults born at term (C). The key findings include:
1. Ex-ELBW subjects had lower ADMA levels than the control group (0.606+0.095 vs 0.562+0.101 μmol/L, p<0.05).
2. There was an inverse correlation between ADMA levels and gestational age (r=-0.61, p<0.00001) and birth weight (r=-0.57, p<0.0002).
3. The study does not directly address whether these lower ADMA levels predict an early endothelial dysfunction in the ex-ELBW group.
4. The context mentions that high levels of ADMA are associated with adverse cardiovascular events but does not provide evidence linking lower levels of ADMA to endothelial dysfunction.

Problem:
Is obesity a risk factor for wheezing among adolescents?

Context:
To investigate the effect of obesity at the start of adolescence on the prevalence, incidence and maintenance of chest wheezing among individuals aged 11-15 years in a birth cohort in a developing country. The seventh follow-up of the 1993 Pelotas birth cohort occurred in 2004 (individuals aged 10-11 years). Between January and August 2008, the eighth follow-up of the cohort was conducted. All the individuals of the original cohort who were alive (who were then adolescents aged between 14 and 15 years) were targets for the study. The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire was used to define wheezing. In addition to the body mass index (BMI), used to define obesity by the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, we assessed skinfold thickness. From the original cohort, 4,349 individuals were located (85.7% follow-up rate). The prevalence of chest wheezing at 11 and 15 years were 13.5% (95% CI: 12.5%-14.5%) and 12.1% (95% CI: 11.1%-13.1%), respectively. The prevalence of wheezing at both times was 4.5% (95% CI: 3.9%-5.1%) and the incidence of wheezing was 7.5% (95% CI: 6.7%-8.3%). Independent of the effect of various confounding variables, the prevalence of wheezing at 15 years was 50% greater among obese individuals than among eutrophic individuals at 11 years (RR 1.53; 95% CI: 1.14-2.05). The greater the skinfold tertile at 11 years, the higher the prevalence of wheezing at 15 years was (p = .011). Weight status and skinfolds did not present any association with incident wheezing. After controlling for confounding factors, the risk of persistent wheezing among obese individuals at 11 years was 1.82 (95% CI: 1.30-2.54).

Problem:
Can early second-look tympanoplasty reduce the rate of conversion to modified radical mastoidectomy?

Context:
The aims of the study were to report the rates of recurrent and residual cholesteatoma following primary CAT surgery and to report the rate of conversion to a modified radical mastoidectomy. This was a retrospective review of a single surgeon series between 2006 and 2012. In total 132 second-look operations were undertaken, with a mean interval between primary surgery and second-look procedures of 6 months. The rate of cholesteatoma at second-look surgery was 19.7%, which was split into residual disease (10.6%) and recurrent disease (9.09%). New tympanic membrane defects with cholesteatoma were considered as recurrent disease. Residual disease was defined as cholesteatoma present behind an intact tympanic membrane. The majority of recurrent and residual disease was easily removed at second look (73.1%). Only four cases were converted to a modified radical mastoidectomy (3%) and three cases required a third-look procedure.

<context>Analysis of the context and key facts
The context describes a study that examines the outcomes of secondary tympanoplasty procedures, specifically focusing on the rate of recurrent and residual cholesteatoma and the rate of conversion to modified radical mastoidectomy. Key facts include:

1. The study involved 132 second-look operations over a period of 6 years.
2. The average time interval between primary surgery and the second-look operation was 6 months.
3. The rate of cholesteatoma found at the second-look surgery was 19.7%.
4. Of this, 10.6% were residual disease and 9.09% were recurrent disease.
5. Most recurrent and residual cases (73.1%) could be managed without converting to a more extensive procedure.
6. Only 3 out of 132 cases (2.27%) were converted to a modified radical mastoidectomy, and another 3 cases required a third-look procedure.

There is no direct mention of early second-look tympanoplasty in the provided context, nor does it indicate any specific reduction in the rate of conversion to modified radical mast

Problem:
Does the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale favor left hemisphere strokes?

Context:
The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a valid, reproducible scale that measures neurological deficit. Of 42 possible points, 7 points are directly related to measurement of language compared with only 2 points related to neglect. We examined the placebo arm of the NINDS t-PA stroke trial to test the hypothesis that the total volume of cerebral infarction in patients with right hemisphere strokes would be greater than the volume of cerebral infarction in patients with left hemisphere strokes who have similar NIHSS scores. The volume of stroke was determined by computerized image analysis of CT films and CT images stored on computer tape and optical disks. Cube-root transformation of lesion volume was performed for each CT. Transformed lesion volume was analyzed in a logistic regression model to predict volume of stroke by NIHSS score for each hemisphere. Spearman rank correlation was used to determine the relation between the NIHSS score and lesion volume. The volume for right hemisphere stroke was statistically greater than the volume for left hemisphere strokes, adjusting for the baseline NIHSS (P<0. 001). For each 5-point category of the NIHSS score<20, the median volume of right hemisphere strokes was approximately double the median volume of left hemisphere strokes. For example, for patients with a left hemisphere stroke and a 24-hour NIHSS score of 16 to 20, the median volume of cerebral infarction was 48 mL (interquartile range 14 to 111 mL) as compared with 133 mL (interquartile range 81 to 208 mL) for patients with a right hemisphere stroke (P<0.001). The median volume of a right hemisphere stroke was roughly equal to the median volume of a left hemisphere stroke in the next highest 5-point category of the NIHSS. The Spearman rank correlation between the 24-hour NIHSS score and 3-month lesion volume was 0.72 for patients with left hemisphere stroke and 0.71 for patients with right hemisphere stroke.

Answer: maybe
</answer>

<analysis>
The key facts extracted from the context are:
1. The NIHSS measures neurological deficits with 42 possible points.
2. 7 points are related to language, while only 2 points are related to neglect.
3. A study found that the volume of cerebral infarction in patients with right hemisphere strokes was greater than in those with left hemisphere strokes, when controlling for the NIHSS score.
4. For each 5-point category of the NIHSS score below 20, the median volume of right hemisphere strokes was approximately double the median volume of left hemisphere strokes.
5. The correlation between the NIHSS score and lesion volume was high for both left and right hemisphere strokes.

There is no direct statement or evidence within the context that explicitly favors the NIHSS in favoring left hemisphere strokes. Instead, it highlights a relationship where right hemisphere strokes tend to have larger volumes than left hemisphere strokes, even when adjusted for NIHSS scores.
</analysis>
Answer: maybe

The context provides information about the NIHSS's relationship with stroke volume and does not explicitly state a preference for left hemisphere strokes

Problem:
Dose end-tidal carbon dioxide measurement correlate with arterial carbon dioxide in extremely low birth weight infants in the first week of life?

Context:
To study the correlation and agreement between end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) and arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)) in ventilated extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants in the first week of life. Retrospective chart review of all ELBW (<1,000 g) infants admitted to a level III NICU from January 2003 to December 2003. Data collected included demographic details and simultaneous EtCO(2) (mainstream capnography) and arterial blood gas values (pH, PaCO(2), PaO(2)). The correlation coefficient, degree of bias with 95% confidence interval between the EtCO(2) and PaCO(2). There were 754 end-tidal and arterial CO(2) pairs from 31 ELBW infants (21 male and 10 female). The overall EtCO(2) values were significantly lower than PaCO(2) value. In only 89/754(11.8%) pairs, the EtCO(2) was higher than the PaCO(2). The overall bias was 5.6 +/- 6.9 mmHg (95% C.I. 5.11-6.09). The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.81. Using EtCO2 ranges of 30 to 50 mmHg, the capnographic method was able to identify 84% of instances where PaCO(2) was between 35 (<35 = hypocarbia) and 55 mmHg (>55= hypercapnia).

Problem:
Is the Distance Worth It?

Context:
It is unclear whether traveling long distances to high-volume centers would compensate for travel burden among patients undergoing rectal cancer resection. The purpose of this study was to determine whether operative volume outweighs the advantages of being treated locally by comparing the outcomes of patients with rectal cancer treated at local, low-volume centers versus far, high-volume centers. This was a population-based study. The National Cancer Database was queried for patients with rectal cancer. Patients with stage II or III rectal cancer who underwent surgical resection between 2006 and 2012 were included. The outcomes of interest were margins, lymph node yield, receipt of neoadjuvant chemoradiation, adjuvant chemotherapy, readmission within 30 days, 30-day and 90-day mortality, and 5-year overall survival. A total of 18,605 patients met inclusion criteria; 2067 patients were in the long-distance/high-volume group and 1362 in the short-distance/low-volume group. The median travel distance was 62.6 miles for the long-distance/high-volume group and 2.3 miles for the short-distance/low-volume group. Patients who were younger, white, privately insured, and stage III were more likely to have traveled to a high-volume center. When controlled for patient factors, stage, and hospital factors, patients in the short-distance/low-volume group had lower odds of a lymph node yield ≥12 (OR = 0.51) and neoadjuvant chemoradiation (OR = 0.67) and higher 30-day (OR = 3.38) and 90-day mortality (OR = 2.07) compared with those in the long-distance/high-volume group. The short-distance/low-volume group had a 34% high risk of overall mortality at 5 years compared with the long-distance/high-volume group. We lacked data regarding patient and physician decision making and surgeon-specific factors.

The context discusses a study comparing outcomes of patients with rectal cancer treated at local, low-volume centers versus those treated at far, high-volume centers. Key facts extracted from the context include:

- The study aimed to evaluate if the benefits of treatment at high-volume centers outweigh the disadvantages of the long travel distance.
- The study included patients with stage II or III rectal cancer who underwent surgical resection between 2006 and 2012.
- Patients in the long-distance/high-volume group had a median travel distance of 62.6 miles, while those in the short-distance/low-volume group had a median travel distance of 2.3 miles.
- Adjusted analyses showed that patients in the short-distance/low-volume group had lower odds of achieving a lymph node yield ≥12 and receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiation.
- These patients also had higher risks of 30-day and 90-day mortality compared to those in the long-distance/high-volume group.
- The 5-year overall survival rate was higher for patients in the long-distance/high-volume group.
- Patient factors such as age, race, insurance status, and tumor stage

Problem:
Impact of MPH programs: contributing to health system strengthening in low- and middle-income countries?

Context:
The "health workforce" crisis has led to an increased interest in health professional education, including MPH programs. Recently, it was questioned whether training of mid- to higher level cadres in public health prepared graduates with competencies to strengthen health systems in low- and middle-income countries. Measuring educational impact has been notoriously difficult; therefore, innovative methods for measuring the outcome and impact of MPH programs were sought. Impact was conceptualized as "impact on workplace" and "impact on society," which entailed studying how these competencies were enacted and to what effect within the context of the graduates' workplaces, as well as on societal health. This is part of a larger six-country mixed method study; in this paper, the focus is on the qualitative findings of two English language programs, one a distance MPH program offered from South Africa, the other a residential program in the Netherlands. Both offer MPH training to students from a diversity of countries. In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 graduates (per program), working in low- and middle-income health systems, their peers, and their supervisors. Impact on the workplace was reported as considerable by graduates and peers as well as supervisors and included changes in management and leadership: promotion to a leadership position as well as expanded or revitalized management roles were reported by many participants. The development of leadership capacity was highly valued amongst many graduates, and this capacity was cited by a number of supervisors and peers. Wider impact in the workplace took the form of introducing workplace innovations such as setting up an AIDS and addiction research center and research involvement; teaching and training, advocacy, and community engagement were other ways in which graduates' influence reached a wider target grouping. Beyond the workplace, an intersectoral approach, national reach through policy advisory roles to Ministries of Health, policy development, and capacity building, was reported. Work conditions and context influenced conduciveness for innovation and the extent to which graduates were able to have effect. Self-selection of graduates and their role in selecting peers and supervisors may have resulted in some bias, some graduates could not be traced, and social acceptability bias may have influenced findings.

Problem:
Does the early adopter of drugs exist?

Context:
To analyse associations between indicators for adoption of new drugs and to test the hypothesis that physicians' early adoption of new drugs is a personal trait independent of drug groups. In a population-based cohort study using register data, we analysed the prescribing of new drugs by Danish general practitioners. Angiotensin-II antagonists, triptans, selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 antagonists and esomeprazol were used in the assessment. As indicators of new drug uptake, we used adoption time, cumulative incidence, preference proportion, incidence rate and prescription cost and volume. For each measure, we ranked the general practices. Ranks were pair-wise plotted, and Pearson's correlation coefficient ( r) was calculated. Next, we analysed the correlation between ranks across different drug classes. For all indicators, the general practitioners' adoption of one group of drugs was poorly associated with adoption of others ( r</=0.49), indicating that early adoption of one type of drugs is not associated with early adoption of another. For all drug groups, adoption time adjusted for practice size was only weakly associated with other indicators ( r: -0.56 to -0.27). Indicators, based on cost and volume of drugs, were highly correlated ( r: 0.96-0.99), and the others correlated reasonably well ( r: 0.51-0.91).

Context:
A multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach to breast cancer management is the gold standard. The aim is to evaluate MDT decision making in a modern breast unit. All referrals to the breast MDT where breast cancer was diagnosed from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2011 were included. Multidisciplinary team decisions were compared with subsequent patient management and classified as concordant or discordant. Over the study period, there were 3230 MDT decisions relating to 705 patients. Overall, 91.5% (2956 out of 3230) of decisions were concordant, 4.5% (146 out of 3230), were discordant and 4% (128 out of 3230) had no MDT decision. Of 146 discordant decisions, 26 (17.8%) were considered 'unjustifiable' as there was no additional information available after the MDT to account for the change in management. The remaining 120 discordant MDT decisions were considered 'justifiable', as management was altered due to patient choice (n=61), additional information available after MDT (n=54) or MDT error (n=5).

Problem:
Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN): a role for polymorphisms in the beta-adrenergic receptor (ADRB) encoding genes?

Context:
DNA was collected for genotyping from 73 term newborns suffering from TTN and 55 healthy controls from a Caucasian cohort. TTN infants were more likely to be male (70% vs. 49%; p<0.05), had a lower mean birthweight (3120 +/- 450 vs. 3396 +/- 504 g; p<0.001) and gestational age (GA) (38.4 +/- 1.2 vs. 39.4 +/- 1.3 weeks; p<0.001) and were more often delivered by caesarean section (CS) (71% vs. 26%; p<0.001). The beta1Ser49Gly polymorphism differed significantly between cases and controls. Multivariate analysis provided beta1Gly49 homozygotes with higher risk for TTN (OR 18.5; 95%CI 1.5-229; p = 0.023) than beta1Ser49 allele carrier. Further analysis showed significant association of T-47C, A46G, C79G and C491T (TACC) haplotype in ADRB2 gene with TTN (p = 0.048).

Problem:
Has the mammography quality standards act affected the mammography quality in North Carolina?

Context:
The United States Food and Drug Administration implemented federal regulations governing mammography under the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) of 1992. During 1995, its first year in implementation, we examined the impact of the MQSA on the quality of mammography in North Carolina. All mammography facilities were inspected during 1993-1994, and again in 1995. Both inspections evaluated mean glandular radiation dose, phantom image evaluation, darkroom fog, and developer temperature. Two mammography health specialists employed by the North Carolina Division of Radiation Protection performed all inspections and collected and codified data. The percentage of facilities that met quality standards increased from the first inspection to the second inspection. Phantom scores passing rate was 31.6% versus 78.2%; darkroom fog passing rate was 74.3% versus 88.5%; and temperature difference passing rate was 62.4% versus 86.9%.

Problem:
Chemotherapy and survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma: is pneumologists' skepticism justified?

Context:
Few studies have assessed whether the advantage chemotherapy has been shown to have in treating advanced non-small lung carcinoma in clinical trials is transferrable to normal health care activity. This could explain the skepticism of a large number of pneumologists towards this treatment. The objective of our study was to analyze prognostic factors related to survival and to see whether cytostatic treatment was an independent predictor. Patients enrolled in the study had been diagnosed with non-small cell carcinoma in stages IV or IIIB with pleural or N2-N3 involvement and with a performance status of 2 or below according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). Survival was analyzed with regard to the following variables: age, sex, comorbidity, weight loss, laboratory test results, histological type, ECOG score, TNM staging, and treatment. The Student t test, the chi(2) test, the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis were used in the statistical analysis. We enrolled 190 patients (157 men and 33 women) with a mean (SD) age of 61.75 (10.85) years (range, 33-85 years). Of these patients, 144 received cytostatic treatment and 46 palliative treatment. The median survival was 31 weeks and was related to absence of weight loss (hazard ratio [HR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-2.39; P=.001), cytostatic treatment (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.25-2.76; P=.002), and ECOG score of 0 to 1 (HR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.62-5.00; P=.0001). In patients with ECOG scores of 0 to 1, weight loss and treatment were significant prognostic factors. Survival in the ECOG 2 group was 15 weeks for patients undergoing cytostatic treatment and 11 weeks for patients with symptomatic treatment.

Context:
To determine whether the OraQuick® HIV-1/2 Assay (OraSure Technologies, Inc., Bethlehem, PA, USA) in sputum is a valid tool for HIV surveillance among TB patients. A cross sectional study was carried out on sputa of patients diagnosed with tuberculosis. Sputa were tested for antibodies to HIV using OraQuick® HIV-1/2 Assay (OraSure Technologies, Inc., Bethlehem, PA, USA). The results were compared with results of serum ELISA. Compared to serum ELISA, the OraQuick® HIV-1/2 Assay in sputum specimens reported 90% sensitivity (9/10) and 100% specificity (307/307), with a positive predictive value of 100% (95%CI: 66.37%-100.00%) and a negative predictive value of 99.68% (95%CI: 98.20%-99.99%).

Problem:
Pituitary apoplexy: do histological features influence the clinical presentation and outcome?

Context:
A retrospective analysis of a contemporary series of patients with pituitary apoplexy was performed to ascertain whether the histopathological features influence the clinical presentation or the outcome. A retrospective analysis was performed in 59 patients treated for pituitary apoplexy at the University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, Virginia, or Groote Schuur Hospital, University of Cape Town, South Africa. The patients were divided into two groups according to the histological features of their disease: one group with infarction alone, comprising 22 patients; and the other with hemorrhagic infarction and/or frank hemorrhage, comprising 37 patients. The presenting symptoms, clinical features, endocrinological status, and outcome were compared between the two groups.

Follow the specified XML output strictly. Use the given context and question to reason about the problem and provide an answer. No need to include explanations in the XML tags.

<reasoning>Pituitary apoplexy is a condition where there is sudden hemorrhage and/or infarction of the pituitary gland, leading to various clinical manifestations. The study analyzed a series of 59 patients with pituitary apoplexy, stratifying them based on the presence or absence of hemorrhage in the histological findings. It was found that patients with hemorrhagic infarction and/or frank hemorrhage had significantly different clinical presentations and outcomes compared to those with infarction alone. This indicates that histological features can indeed influence the clinical presentation and outcome of pituitary apoplexy.</reasoning>

Problem:
Does laparoscopic surgery decrease the risk of atrial fibrillation after foregut surgery?

Context:
Atrial fibrillation, which occurs in 12% of all major foregut surgeries, can prolong hospital stay and increase morbidity. Minimally invasive techniques in foregut surgery have been suggested to cause less tissue trauma. We examined the factors associated with new-onset atrial fibrillation after foregut surgery at our institution. We retrospectively examined the records of 154 adult patients who underwent major foregut surgery which included esophagectomy, partial or total gastrectomy, redo Heller myotomy, redo or transthoracic fundoplications. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis with standard modeling techniques were performed to determine risk factors for new-onset atrial fibrillation. Of the 154 patients, 14 patients developed new-onset atrial fibrillation with a higher mean age of 67.1 years (+/-8.8 years) versus 56.4 years (+/-14.1 years) (p = 0.006). Laparoscopic (p = 0.004) and nonthoracic surgeries (p = 0.01) were associated with lower risk of atrial fibrillation. Patients with atrial fibrillation had received more fluid (6.5 +/- 2.8 liters versus 5.3 +/- 2.0 liters) and had longer operations (370 +/- 103 min versus 362 +/- 142 min), none of which were statistically significant. The average intensive care length of stay of patients was longer: 7.5 +/- 6.8 days versus 4.0 +/- 7.1 days (p = 0.004). Multivariate analysis revealed an association of atrial fibrillation with age (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.14, p = 0.01), and laparoscopic surgery (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01-0.95, p = 0.04) after adjusting for surgery type.

Problem:
Is routine chest radiography after transbronchial biopsy necessary?

Context:
Pneumothorax following flexible bronchoscopy (FB) with transbronchial biopsy (TBB) occurs in 1 to 6% of cases. Routine chest radiography (CXR) following TBB is therefore requested by most pulmonologists in an attempt to detect complications, particularly pneumothorax. The objective of this study was to determine if routine CXR after bronchoscopy and TBB is necessary. The study group included 350 consecutive patients who underwent FB with TBB at our institution between December 2001 and January 2004. Routine CXR was performed up to 2 h after the procedure in all cases. Additionally, the following information was recorded in all patients: sex, age, immune status, indication for bronchoscopy, total number of biopsies done, segment sampled, pulse oxygen saturation, and development of symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax. Pneumothorax was diagnosed radiologically in 10 patients (2.9%). Seven patients had symptoms strongly suggestive of pneumothorax prior to CXR, including four patients with large (>10%) pneumothorax. The other three patients were asymptomatic, with only minimal pneumothorax (</= 10%), which resolved completely 24 to 48 h later.

Follow the specified XML output strictly. Analysis: <analysis>
The context discusses a study that aimed to determine the necessity of performing routine chest radiography (CXR) after transbronchial biopsy (TBB). Key facts include:

1. Pneumothorax following flexible bronchoscopy (FB) with TBB occurs in 1 to 6% of cases.
2. The study included 350 consecutive patients who underwent FB with TBB over a specific period.
3. Routine CXR was performed up to 2 hours post-procedure in all cases.
4. Pneumothorax was diagnosed radiographically in 10 patients (2.9%).
5. Out of these 10 patients, 7 had symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax before the CXR.
6. Three of the patients were asymptomatic with minimal pneumothorax, which resolved without intervention.
7. The study did not clearly state whether routine CXR added value or was unnecessary given the symptoms and resolution of pneumothorax in some cases.

There is no direct contradiction within the provided information, but the relevance to the necessity of routine CXR is somewhat ambiguous due to the small percentage of cases where pneumothorax occurred and the varying outcomes in symptomatic and asympt

Problem:
Do Electrochemiluminescence Assays Improve Prediction of Time to Type 1 Diabetes in Autoantibody-Positive TrialNet Subjects?

Context:
To explore whether electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assays can help improve prediction of time to type 1 diabetes in the TrialNet autoantibody-positive population. TrialNet subjects who were positive for one or more autoantibodies (microinsulin autoantibody, GAD65 autoantibody [GADA], IA-2A, and ZnT8A) with available ECL-insulin autoantibody (IAA) and ECL-GADA data at their initial visit were analyzed; after a median follow-up of 24 months, 177 of these 1,287 subjects developed diabetes. Univariate analyses showed that autoantibodies by radioimmunoassays (RIAs), ECL-IAA, ECL-GADA, age, sex, number of positive autoantibodies, presence of HLA DR3/4-DQ8 genotype, HbA1c, and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) measurements were all significantly associated with progression to diabetes. Subjects who were ECL positive had a risk of progression to diabetes within 6 years of 58% compared with 5% for the ECL-negative subjects (P<0.0001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were compared, with the base model including age, sex, OGTT measurements, and number of positive autoantibodies by RIAs. The model with positivity for ECL-GADA and/or ECL-IAA was the best, and factors that remained significantly associated with time to diabetes were area under the curve (AUC) C-peptide, fasting C-peptide, AUC glucose, number of positive autoantibodies by RIAs, and ECL positivity. Adding ECL to the Diabetes Prevention Trial risk score (DPTRS) improved the receiver operating characteristic curves with AUC of 0.83 (P<0.0001).

Problem:
Blunt trauma in intoxicated patients: is computed tomography of the abdomen always necessary?

Context:
Physical examination to detect abdominal injuries has been considered unreliable in alcohol-intoxicated trauma patients. Computed tomography (CT) plays the primary role in these abdominal evaluations. We reviewed medical records of all blunt trauma patients admitted to our trauma service from January 1, 1992, to March 31, 1998. Study patients had a blood alcohol level>or =80 mg/dL, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15, and unremarkable abdominal examination. Of 324 patients studied, 317 (98%) had CT scans negative for abdominal injury. Abdominal injuries were identified in 7 patients (2%), with only 2 (0.6%) requiring abdominal exploration. A significant association was found between major chest injury and abdominal injury.

Problem:
Identification of racial disparities in breast cancer mortality: does scale matter?

Context:
This paper investigates the impact of geographic scale (census tract, zip code, and county) on the detection of disparities in breast cancer mortality among three ethnic groups in Texas (period 1995-2005). Racial disparities were quantified using both relative (RR) and absolute (RD) statistics that account for the population size and correct for unreliable rates typically observed for minority groups and smaller geographic units. Results were then correlated with socio-economic status measured by the percentage of habitants living below the poverty level. African-American and Hispanic women generally experience higher mortality than White non-Hispanics, and these differences are especially significant in the southeast metropolitan areas and southwest border of Texas. The proportion and location of significant racial disparities however changed depending on the type of statistic (RR versus RD) and the geographic level. The largest proportion of significant results was observed for the RD statistic and census tract data. Geographic regions with significant racial disparities for African-Americans and Hispanics frequently had a poverty rate above 10.00%.

<requirement>Answer: yes/no/maybe</requirement>
<analysis>
The context discusses the impact of geographic scale on identifying racial disparities in breast cancer mortality in Texas from 1995 to 2005. Key facts include:

1. Racial disparities are measured using both relative risk (RR) and absolute difference (RD) statistics.
2. Significant racial disparities are more pronounced when using RD statistics at the census tract level.
3. There is a correlation between the presence of significant racial disparities and high poverty rates.
4. African-American and Hispanic women experience higher breast cancer mortality compared to White non-Hispanic women.
5. The geographic scale (census tract, zip code, and county) affects the detection of disparities, with census tract data showing the highest proportion of significant results.

There are no apparent contradictions in the provided information.

The relevance to the question "Does scale matter?" is clearly addressed, as the study explicitly examines how different scales (census tract, zip code, county) affect the identification of racial disparities in breast cancer mortality.

Problem:
Does case-mix based reimbursement stimulate the development of process-oriented care delivery?

Context:
Reimbursement based on the total care of a patient during an acute episode of illness is believed to stimulate management and clinicians to reduce quality problems like waiting times and poor coordination of care delivery. Although many studies already show that this kind of case-mix based reimbursement leads to more efficiency, it remains unclear whether care coordination improved as well. This study aims to explore whether case-mix based reimbursement stimulates development of care coordination by the use of care programmes, and a process-oriented way of working. Data for this study were gathered during the winter of 2007/2008 in a survey involving all Dutch hospitals. Descriptive and structural equation modelling (SEM) analyses were conducted. SEM reveals that adoption of the case-mix reimbursement within hospitals' budgeting processes stimulates hospitals to establish care programmes by the use of process-oriented performance measures. However, the implementation of care programmes is not (yet) accompanied by a change in focus from function (the delivery of independent care activities) to process (the delivery of care activities as being connected to a chain of interdependent care activities).

Problem:
Does receipt of hospice care in nursing homes improve the management of pain at the end of life?

Context:
To compare analgesic management of daily pain for dying nursing home residents enrolled and not enrolled in Medicare hospice. Retrospective, comparative cohort study. Over 800 nursing homes in Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, New York, and South Dakota. A subset of residents with daily pain near the end of life taken from a matched cohort of hospice (2,644) and nonhospice (7,929) nursing home residents who had at least two resident assessments (Minimum Data Sets (MDSs)) completed, their last between 1992 and 1996, and who died before April 1997. The daily pain subset consisted of 709 hospice and 1,326 nonhospice residents. Detailed drug use data contained on the last MDS before death were used to examine analgesic management of daily pain. Guidelines from the American Medical Directors Association (AMDA) were used to identify analgesics not recommended for use in managing chronic pain in long-term care settings. The study outcome, regular treatment of daily pain, examined whether patients received any analgesic, other than those not recommended by AMDA, at least twice a day for each day of documented daily pain (i.e., 7 days before date of last MDS). Fifteen percent of hospice residents and 23% of nonhospice residents in daily pain received no analgesics (odds ratio (OR) = 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.45-0.74). A lower proportion of hospice residents (21%) than of nonhospice residents (29%) received analgesics not recommended by AMDA (OR = 0.65, 95% CI =0.52-0.80). Overall, acetaminophen (not in combination with other drugs) was used most frequently for nonhospice residents (25% of 1,673 prescriptions), whereas morphine derivatives were used most frequently for hospice residents (30% of 1,058 prescriptions). Fifty-one percent of hospice residents and 33% of nonhospice residents received regular treatment for daily pain. Controlling for clinical confounders, hospice residents were twice as likely as nonhospice residents to receive regular treatment for daily pain (adjusted odds ratio = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.68-2.56).

Problem:
Are complex coronary lesions more frequent in patients with diabetes mellitus?

Context:
Coronary atherosclerotic burden is excessive in diabetic patients. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an independent predictor for both death and myocardial infarction. It is not known whether the prevalence of complex coronary lesions, such as bifurcation and ostial lesions, is different in diabetics from nondiabetics. The aim of present study was to investigate the prevalence of these lesions in patients with DM. One thousand fourteen consecutive patients (mean age 61.3+/-10.7 years) were investigated. Coronary angiograms were examined for bifurcation and ostial lesions using a digital quantitative system. Patients were classified as diabetic (n=281) or nondiabetic (n=733). Patient mean age, and rates of hypertension and hyperlipidemia were significantly higher in the diabetic group than in the nondiabetic group (P<0.0001), although smoking was significantly lower (P=0.001). Reasons for coronary angiography and treatment were comparable between the two groups. The prevalence of bifurcation lesions and ostial lesions was significantly greater in the diabetic group than in the nondiabetic group (9.8% versus 4.3% [P=0.001] and 38.4% versus 29.2% [P=0.003]in the diabetic group versus the nondiabetic group). The presence of DM and greater age were found to be independent predictors for bifurcation lesions (OR=2.27 [P=0.004] and OR=1.03 [P=0.01], for DM and age, respectively) and ostial lesions (OR=1.40 [P=0.027] and OR=1.02 [P=0.001], for DM and age, respectively) in multivariate analysis.

Problem:
Does desflurane alter left ventricular function when used to control surgical stimulation during aortic surgery?

Context:
Although desflurane is commonly used to control surgically induced hypertension, its effects on left ventricular (LV) function have not been investigated in this clinical situation. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the LV function response to desflurane, when used to control intraoperative hypertension. In 50 patients, scheduled for vascular surgery, anesthesia was induced with sufentanil 0.5 microg/kg, midazolam 0.3 mg/kg and atracurium 0.5 mg/kg. After tracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with increments of drugs with controlled ventilation (N2O/O2=60/40%) until the start of surgery. A 5 Mhz transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe was inserted after intubation. Pulmonary artery catheter and TEE measurements were obtained after induction (to)(control value), at surgical incision (t1) if it was associated with an increase in systolic arterial pressure (SAP) greater than 140 mmHg (hypertension) and after control of hemodynamic parameters by administration of desflurane (return of systolic arterial pressure to within 20% of the control value) (t2) in a fresh gas flow of 31/ min. Sixteen patients developed hypertension at surgical incision. SAP was controlled by desflurane in all 16 patients. Afterload assessed by systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), end-systolic wall-stress (ESWS) and left-ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI) increased with incision until the hypertension returned to post-induction values with mean end-tidal concentration of 5.1+/-0.7% desflurane. No change in heart rate, cardiac index, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, stroke volume, end-diastolic and end-systolic cross-sectional areas, fractional area change and left ventricular circumferential fiber shortening was noted when desflurane was added to restore blood pressure.

Problem:
Thrombosis prophylaxis in hospitalised medical patients: does prophylaxis in all patients make sense?

Context:
Most studies on thrombosis prophylaxis focus on postoperative venous thrombosis. In medical wards thrombosis prophylaxis is generally restricted to patients who are immobilised. Our primary aim was to investigate the incidence of venous thrombosis in a general internal ward, to assess whether more rigorous prophylaxis would be feasible. We investigated the incidence of venous thrombosis in patients hospitalised from 1992 to 1996 and related our findings to literature reports. The incidence of symptomatic venous thrombosis in internal patients during hospitalisation was 39/6332 (0.6%). Among these 39 patients, 24 had a malignancy, whereas 876 out of all 6332 patients had a known malignancy. So, the incidence in this group with cancer was 2.7% compared with 0.3% (15/5456) in the non-cancer group (relative risk for venous thrombosis due to malignancy was 10.0 (95%C.I. 5.3-18.9).

Problem:
Is leptin involved in phagocytic NADPH oxidase overactivity in obesity?

Context:
Hyperleptinemia and oxidative stress play a major role in the development of cardiovascular diseases in obesity. This study aimed to investigate whether there is a relationship between plasma levels of leptin and phagocytic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity, and its potential relevance in the vascular remodeling in obese patients. The study was performed in 164 obese and 94 normal-weight individuals (controls). NADPH oxidase activity was evaluated by luminescence in phagocytic cells. Levels of leptin were quantified by ELISA in plasma samples. Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) was measured by ultrasonography. In addition, we performed in-vitro experiments in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and murine macrophages. Phagocytic NADPH oxidase activity and leptin levels were enhanced (P<0.05) in obese patients compared with controls. NADPH oxidase activity positively correlated with leptin in obese patients. This association remained significant in a multivariate analysis. cIMT was higher (P<0.05) in obese patients compared with controls. In addition, cIMT also correlated positively with leptin and NADPH oxidase activity in obese patients. In-vitro studies showed that leptin induced NADPH oxidase activation. Inhibition of the leptin-induced NADPH oxidase activity by wortmannin and bisindolyl maleimide suggested a direct involvement of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase C pathways, respectively. Finally, leptin-induced NADPH oxidase activation promoted macrophage proliferation.

Problem:
Are pediatric concussion patients compliant with discharge instructions?

Context:
Concussions are commonly diagnosed in pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). The primary objective of this study was to evaluate compliance with ED discharge instructions for concussion management. A prospective cohort study was conducted from November 2011 to November 2012 in a pediatric ED at a regional Level 1 trauma center, serving 35,000 pediatric patients per year. Subjects were aged 8 years to 17 years and were discharged from the ED with a diagnosis of concussion. Exclusion criteria included recent (past 3 months) diagnosis of head injury, hospital admission, intracranial injury, skull fracture, suspected nonaccidental trauma, or preexisting neurologic condition. Subjects were administered a baseline survey in the ED and were given standardized discharge instructions for concussion by the treating physician. Telephone follow-up surveys were conducted at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after ED visit. A total of 150 patients were enrolled. The majority (67%) of concussions were sports related. Among sports-related concussions, soccer (30%), football (11%), lacrosse (8%), and basketball (8%) injuries were most common. More than one third (39%) reported return to play (RTP) on the day of the injury. Physician follow-up was equivalent for sport and nonsport concussions (2 weeks, 58%; 4 weeks, 64%). Sports-related concussion patients were more likely to follow up with a trainer (2 weeks, 25% vs. 10%, p = 0.06; 4 weeks, 29% vs. 8%, p<0.01). Of the patients who did RTP or normal activities at 2 weeks (44%), more than one third (35%) were symptomatic, and most (58%) did not receive medical clearance. Of the patients who had returned to activities at 4 weeks (64%), less than one quarter (23%) were symptomatic, and most (54%) received medical clearance.

Problem:
The use of audit to identify maternal mortality in different settings: is it just a difference between the rich and the poor?

Context:
To illustrate how maternal mortality audit identifies different causes of and contributing factors to maternal deaths in different settings in low- and high-income countries and how this can lead to local solutions in reducing maternal deaths. Descriptive study of maternal mortality from different settings and review of data on the history of reducing maternal mortality in what are now high-income countries. Kalabo district in Zambia, Farafenni division in The Gambia, Onandjokwe district in Namibia, and the Netherlands. Population of rural areas in Zambia and The Gambia, peri-urban population in Namibia and nationwide data from The Netherlands. Data from facility-based maternal mortality audits from three African hospitals and data from the latest confidential enquiry in The Netherlands. Maternal mortality ratio (MMR), causes (direct and indirect) and characteristics. MMR ranged from 10 per 100,000 (the Netherlands) to 1540 per 100,000 (The Gambia). Differences in causes of deaths were characterized by HIV/AIDS in Namibia, sepsis and HIV/AIDS in Zambia, (pre-)eclampsia in the Netherlands and obstructed labour in The Gambia.

<problem>
Is the difference in maternal mortality identified through audit mainly due to economic disparities between rich and poor countries?
</problem> Answer: maybe
Explanation: The question asks whether the primary cause of differences in maternal mortality identified through audit is economic disparity. The context shows that there are indeed differences in causes of death between the settings, such as HIV/AIDS being more prevalent in Namibia and Zambia compared to the Netherlands, and obstructed labor being a significant factor in The Gambia. These differences could be influenced by economic factors, but other variables such as healthcare infrastructure, access to care, and specific cultural or societal factors may also play roles. Therefore, while economic disparity is a significant factor, it is not the sole cause of these differences, making the answer "maybe." Answer: maybe

Problem:
Is the 7th TNM edition suitable for biological predictor in early gastric cancer?

Context:
The clinical and prognostic value of the previous node classification of TNM staging in early gastric cancer (EGC) has been less definitive. The aim was to assess the suitability of the revised node staging for prediction of clinical behavior of EGC. Between 2005 and 2008, 1,845 patients were diagnosed with EGC and underwent surgery at Severance Hospitals. Clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed with comparisons between sixth and seventh TNM staging. When comparing IB with IIA upstaged based on seventh staging, poor differentiation, signet ring cell, diffuse, undifferentiated types, perineural invasion (PNI), larger size and younger age, were more significantly associated with IIA. Clinicopathological factors were compared between N0/N1 and N2/N3 based on both staging. In mucosal cancer, younger age, diffuse and undifferentiated types were more significantly associated with N2/N3 based on seventh staging. In submucosal cancer, larger size, poor differentiation, signet ring cell, diffuse, undifferentiated types, PNI and deeper submucosal invasion, were more significantly associated with N2/N3 based on seventh staging.

Problem:
Is there a relationship between complex fractionated atrial electrograms recorded during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation?

Context:
Ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) may require adjunctive methods of substrate modification. Both ablation-targeting complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) recorded during AF and fractionated electrograms recorded during sinus rhythm (sinus rhythm fractionation [SRF]) have been described. However, the relationship of CFAEs with SRF is unclear. Twenty patients (age 62 ± 9 years, 13 males) with persistent AF and 9 control subjects without organic heart disease or AF (age 36 ± 6 years, 4 males) underwent detailed CFAE and SRF left atrial electroanatomic maps. The overlap in left atrial regions with CFAEs and SRF was compared in the AF population, and the distribution of SRF was compared among patients with AF and normal controls. Propagation maps were analyzed to identify the activation patterns associated with SR fractionation. SRF (338 ± 150 points) and CFAE (418 ± 135 points) regions comprised 29% ± 14% and 25% ± 15% of the left atrial surface area, respectively. There was no significant correlation between SRF and CFAE maps (r = .2; P = NS). On comparing patients with AF and controls, no significant difference was found in the distribution of SRF between groups (P = .74). Regions of SRF overlapped areas of wave-front collision 75% ± 13% of the time.

<analysis> ... </analysis>
Answer: ...

The context discusses the relationship between CFAEs (complex fractionated atrial electrograms) recorded during atrial fibrillation (AF) and SRF (sinus rhythm fractionation) recorded during sinus rhythm. It involves a study where detailed electroanatomic maps were created for both CFAE and SRF in a group of patients with persistent AF and compared with healthy controls. The key findings include:

1. **Overlap Analysis**: There was no significant correlation between CFAE and SRF maps (r = .2; P = NS).
2. **Distribution Comparison**: No significant difference in the distribution of SRF was found when comparing patients with AF and controls (P = .74).
3. **Wavefront Collision**: Regions with SRF overlapped areas of wave-front collision 75% ± 13% of the time.

Given these key points, it appears that the presence of CFAEs does not necessarily correlate with the presence of SRF. This suggests that while there might be some overlapping regions related to wavefront collision, the overall distribution and correlation between the two types of fractionation are not significant.

Problem:
The association of puberty and young adolescent alcohol use: do parents have a moderating role?

Context:
To explore the extent to which parent-adolescent emotional closeness, family conflict, and parental permissiveness moderate the association of puberty and alcohol use in adolescents (aged 10-14). Cross-sectional survey of 7631 adolescents from 231 Australian schools. Measures included pubertal status, recent (30day) alcohol use, parent-adolescent emotional closeness, family conflict, parental permissiveness of alcohol use and peer alcohol use. The analysis was based on a two-level (individuals nested within schools) logistic regression model, with main effects entered first, and interaction terms added second. The interaction of family factors and pubertal stage did not improve the fit of the model, so a main effect model of family factors and pubertal stage was adopted. There were significant main effects for pubertal stage with boys in middle puberty at increased odds of alcohol use, and girls in advanced puberty at increased odds of alcohol use.

Problem:
Are there gender differences in the reasons why African Americans delay in seeking medical help for symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction?

Context:
To identify gender differences in delay time and the reasons why African Americans delay in seeking medical care for symptoms of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Cross-sectional. Five hospitals in the San Francisco and East Bay areas. Sixty-one African American men and women diagnosed with an AMI. Prehospital delay time. Median delay time was longer for women compared to men (4.4 hours vs 3.5 hours), although the difference was not significant. Single women delayed longer than single men (P = .03), and women who were alone when symptoms began delayed longer than women with someone (P = .03). Women who received advice to seek help or call 911 upon symptom onset had shorter delays compared to women who were not advised to call 911 (P = .01). Men at home delayed longer than men who experienced their symptoms outside the home (P = .01). Men with emergency room insurance delayed longer than men without emergency room insurance (P = .03), and men who took an ambulance to the hospital had shorter delay times than men who took other means of transportation (P = .04).

Problem:
Does age moderate the effect of personality disorder on coping style in psychiatric inpatients?

Context:
To examine age-related differences in the relationship between personality and coping strategies in an Australian population of psychiatric inpatients. Consenting eligible adults (N=238) from 18-100 years of age consecutively admitted to inpatient psychiatry units were assessed using the SCID I and II, the Coping Orientations to Problems Experienced Scale (COPE), the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF), the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS), the 12 Item Short-Form Heath Survey (SF12), the Sarason Social Support Questionnaire, and the NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) (cognitively impaired, and non-English speaking patients were excluded). Older adults reported less symptomatology than younger patients and younger patients described more personality dysfunction than older patients. As assessed by the COPE, older adults reported lower levels of dysfunctional coping strategies than younger adults. Personality traits, social supports, gender, and age predicted coping strategies, while Axis I diagnosis, education, personality disorder, and symptom severity were not significant predictors of coping strategies.

	<analysis>
Key facts:
- The study examined age-related differences in the relationship between personality and coping strategies in a population of psychiatric inpatients.
- Participants included consenting adults aged from 18 to 100 years.
- Older adults had fewer symptoms and reported lower levels of dysfunctional coping strategies compared to younger adults.
- Personality traits, social supports, and gender were significant predictors of coping strategies.
- Axis I diagnosis, education, personality disorder, and symptom severity were not significant predictors of coping strategies.

Relevance to the question:
The study provides evidence that age moderates the effect of personality disorder on coping style among psychiatric inpatients, as older adults reported less dysfunctional coping strategies despite potentially having similar levels of personality disorder.
Contradictions:
- While younger patients described more personality dysfunction, they also had higher levels of dysfunctional coping strategies, which might suggest a different relationship between personality disorder and coping style in younger individuals.

Problem:
Locoregional opening of the rodent blood-brain barrier for paclitaxel using Nd:YAG laser-induced thermo therapy: a new concept of adjuvant glioma therapy?

Context:
Nd:YAG laser-induced thermo therapy (LITT) of rat brains is associated with blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability changes. We address the question of whether LITT-induced locoregional disruption of the BBB could possibly allow a locoregional passage of chemotherapeutic agents into brain tissue to treat malignant glioma.STUDY DESIGN/ CD Fischer rats were subject to LITT of the left forebrain. Disruption of the BBB was analyzed using Evans blue and immunohistochemistry (IH). Animals were perfused with paclitaxel, and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was employed to analyze the content of paclitaxel in brain and plasma samples. LITT induces an opening of the BBB as demonstrated by locoregional extravasation of Evans blue, C3C, fibrinogen, and IgM. HPLC proved the passage of paclitaxel across the disrupted BBB.

The context describes a study where Nd:YAG laser-induced thermo therapy (LITT) is used to induce locoregional opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in the brains of rats. The study confirms that this opening allows the passage of the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel into the brain tissue. The study uses Evans blue, C3C, fibrinogen, and IgM to demonstrate the disruption of the BBB, and HPLC to confirm the passage of paclitaxel.
Key facts:
1. Nd:YAG laser-induced thermo therapy can induce locoregional opening of the BBB in rat brains.
2. This opening allows the passage of the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel into the brain tissue.
3. The disruption of the BBB is confirmed by the extravasation of Evans blue, C3C, fibrinogen, and IgM.
4. Paclitaxel's passage through the disrupted BBB is confirmed by HPLC analysis.

Contradictions: None identified.
Relevance to the question: The context directly addresses the potential use of LITT to open the BBB for the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents like

Problem:
Does reducing spasticity translate into functional benefit?

Context:
Spasticity and loss of function in an affected arm are common after stroke. Although botulinum toxin is used to reduce spasticity, its functional benefits are less easily demonstrated. This paper reports an exploratory meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between reduced arm spasticity and improved arm function. Individual data from stroke patients in two randomised controlled trials of intra-muscular botulinum toxin were pooled. The Modified Ashworth Scale (elbow, wrist, fingers) was used to calculate a "Composite Spasticity Index". Data from the arm section of the Barthel Activities of Daily Living Index (dressing, grooming, and feeding) and three subjective measures (putting arm through sleeve, cleaning palm, cutting fingernails) were summed to give a "Composite Functional Index". Change scores and the time of maximum change were also calculated. Maximum changes in both composite measures occurred concurrently in 47 patients. In 26 patients the improvement in spasticity preceded the improvement in function with 18 showing the reverse. There was a definite relationship between the maximum change in spasticity and the maximum change in arm function, independent of treatment (rho = -0.2822, p = 0.0008, n = 137). There was a clear relationship between the changes in spasticity and in arm function in patients treated with botulinum toxin (Dysport) at 500 or 1000 units (rho = -0.5679, p = 0.0090, n = 22; rho = -0.4430, p = 0.0018, n = 47), but not in those treated with placebo or 1500 units.

Problem:
Is late-night salivary cortisol a better screening test for possible cortisol excess than standard screening tests in obese patients with Type 2 diabetes?

Context:
Forty obese patients with T2DM without clinical features of Cushing's syndrome were recruited. Plasma, urinary and salivary cortisol were measured directly by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using monoclonal antibodies. The specificities of the three tests using various cutoffs were calculated and compared, employing the assumption that none of the patients had hypercortisolism. The patients had a mean age and BMI of 56 years (range 31-75) and 37 kg/m² (31-56) respectively. All 40 provided late-night salivary cortisol samples. Thirty-eight patients completed all three tests. Two patients only completed two screening tests. The specificities of late-night salivary cortisol (cutoff 10 nmol/L), 24hr UFC (400 nmol) and 1mg DST (50 nmol/L) were 70% (95% CI 53-83%), 90% (76-97%) and 72% (55-85%) respectively. The specificity of late-night salivary cortisol was significantly less than 24 hr UFC (P=0.039) but not 1mg DST (P>0.99).

Problem:
Do socioeconomic differences in mortality persist after retirement?

Context:
To assess the risk of death associated with work based and non-work based measures of socioeconomic status before and after retirement age. Follow up study of mortality in relation to employment grade and car ownership over 25 years. The first Whitehall study. 18,133 male civil servants aged 40-69 years who attended a screening examination between 1967 and 1970. Death. Grade of employment was a strong predictor of mortality before retirement. For men dying at ages 40-64 the lowest employment grade had 3.12 times the mortality of the highest grade (95% confidence interval 2.4 to 4.1). After retirement the ability of grade to predict mortality declined (rate ratio 1.86; 1.6 to 2.2). A non-work based measure of socioeconomic status (car ownership) predicted mortality less well than employment grade before retirement but its ability to predict mortality declined less after retirement. Using a relative index of inequality that was sensitive to the distribution among socioeconomic groups showed employment grade and car ownership to have independent associations with mortality that were of equal magnitude after retirement. The absolute difference in death rates between the lowest and highest employment grades increased with age from 12.9 per 1000 person years at ages 40-64 to 38.3 per 1000 at ages 70-89.

The context describes a study that examines the risk of death related to both work-based (employment grade) and non-work-based (car ownership) measures of socioeconomic status before and after retirement. The study involved 18,133 male civil servants, followed for 25 years. Key findings include:

1. Employment grade was a strong predictor of mortality before retirement, with a significant association noted even among younger individuals (ages 40-64).
2. After retirement, the predictive power of employment grade decreased, although it still retained some association with mortality.
3. Car ownership, as a non-work-based measure of socioeconomic status, predicted mortality less well than employment grade before retirement but showed a decline in its predictive ability after retirement was less pronounced.

Problem:
Does successful completion of the Perinatal Education Programme result in improved obstetric practice?

Context:
To determine whether successful completion of the Perinatal Education Programme (PEP) improves obstetric practice. The three midwife obstetric units (MOUs) in a health district of Mpumalanga were included in the study. Two MOUs enrolled in the PEP and the third did not. A 'before-and-after' study design was used to assess any changes in practice, and to monitor whether any changes occurred in the district during the time of the study; data were also collected at the third MOU. Data were collected by scoring of the obstetric files after the patient had delivered. We ascertained whether the obstetric history, syphilis testing, blood group testing, haemoglobin measurement and uterine growth assessment were performed during antenatal care along with whether appropriate action was taken. For intrapartum care, estimation of fetal weight, the performance of pelvimetry, blood pressure monitoring, urine testing, evaluation of head above pelvis, fetal heart rate monitoring, monitoring of contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation, and whether the appropriate actions were taken, were assessed. Eight of the 13 midwives at the two MOUs completed the PEP and all demonstrated an improvement in knowledge. Case notes of 303 patients from the various clinics were studied. There was no change in the referral patterns of any of the clinics during the study period. The obstetric history was well documented, but in no group was there a satisfactory response to a detected problem; appropriate action was taken in between 0% and 12% of cases. Syphilis testing was performed in 56-82% of cases, with no difference between the groups. The haemoglobin level was measured in only 4-15% of patients, with no difference before or after completion of the PEP. Where a problem in uterine growth was detected, an appropriate response occurred in 0-8% of patients and no difference before or after completion of the PEP was ascertained. In all groups, estimation of fetal weight and pelvimetry were seldom performed, the urine and fetal heart rate documentation were moderately well done and the blood pressure monitoring, assessment of head above pelvis, monitoring of contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation were usually performed. No differences before or after the PEP were detected. Where problems were detected, appropriate actions taken during labour improved, but not significantly.

Problem:
Does rugby headgear prevent concussion?

Context:
To examine the attitudes of players and coaches to the use of protective headgear, particularly with respect to the prevention of concussion. A questionnaire designed to assess attitudes to headgear was administered to 63 players from four different Canadian teams, each representing a different level of play (high school, university, community club, national). In addition, coaches from all four levels were questioned about team policies and their personal opinions about the use of headgear to prevent concussion. Although the players tended to believe that the headgear could prevent concussion (62%), the coaches were less convinced (33%). Despite the players' belief that headgear offers protection against concussion, only a minority reported wearing headgear (27%) and few (24%) felt that its use should be made mandatory. Common reasons for not wearing headgear were "its use is not mandatory", "it is uncomfortable", and "it costs too much".

Follow the specified XML output strictly. Do not deviate from the format.

<reasoning>Step-by-step reasoning combining question and context:

1. The question asks if rugby headgear prevents concussion.
2. The context provides information about a study conducted among rugby players and coaches regarding their attitudes towards using headgear to prevent concussions.
3. The study found that players believed that headgear could prevent concussion, but coaches were less convinced of this.
4. Only a small percentage of players actually wore headgear (27%) and even fewer felt it should be mandatory (24%).
5. Reasons for not wearing headgear included it not being mandatory, discomfort, and cost.
6. The study did not provide direct evidence on whether headgear prevents concussion; rather, it indicated that there was a discrepancy between player beliefs and actual usage.
7. The lack of widespread adoption despite player beliefs suggests that either the headgear does not effectively prevent concussion or that players do not perceive the risk of concussion as high enough to warrant the use of headgear.

Conclusion: Based on the available information, there is no clear evidence that rugby headgear prevents concussions, as the study did not provide direct data on effectiveness and the low usage rates suggest limited efficacy or perceived necessity.

Problem:
Is the Retromandibular Transparotid Approach a Reliable Option for the Surgical Treatment of Condylar Fractures?

Context:
This study evaluated the outcomes and complications of the surgical treatment of condylar fractures by the retromandibular transparotid approach. The authors hypothesized that such an approach would be safe and reliable for the treatment of most condylar fractures. A retrospective evaluation of patients who underwent surgical reduction of a condylar fracture from January 2012 to December 2014 at the Clinic of Dentistry and Maxillofacial Surgery of the University Hospital of Verona (Verona, Italy) was performed. Inclusion criteria were having undergone surgical treatment of condylar fractures with a retromandibular transparotid approach and the availability of computed tomograms of the preoperative and postoperative facial skeleton with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Static and dynamic occlusal function, temporomandibular joint health status, presence of neurologic impairments, and esthetic outcomes were evaluated in all patients. The sample was composed of 25 patients. Preinjury occlusion and temporomandibular joint health were restored in most patients. Esthetic outcomes were deemed satisfactory by clinicians and patients. Neither permanent neurologic impairments nor major postoperative complications were observed.

Problem:
Do elderly patients call 911 when presented with clinical scenarios suggestive of acute stroke?

Context:
Among patients with acute stroke symptoms, delay in hospital admission is the main obstacle for the use of thrombolytic therapy and other interventions associated with decreased mortality and disability. The primary aim of this study was to assess whether an elderly clinical population correctly endorsed the response to call for emergency services when presented with signs and symptoms of stroke using a standardized questionnaire. We performed a cross-sectional study among elderly out-patients (≥60 years) in Buenos Aires, Argentina randomly recruited from a government funded health clinic. The correct endorsement of intention to call 911 was assessed with the Stroke Action Test and the cut-off point was set at ≥75%. Knowledge of stroke and clinical and socio-demographic indicators were also collected and evaluated as predictors of correct endorsement using logistic regression. Among 367 elderly adults, 14% correctly endorsed intention to call 911. Presented with the most typical signs and symptoms, only 65% reported that they would call an ambulance. Amaurosis Fugax was the symptom for which was called the least (15%). On average, the correct response was chosen only 37% of the time. Compared to lower levels of education, higher levels were associated to correctly endorsed intention to call 911 (secondary School adjusted OR 3.53, 95% CI 1.59-7.86 and Tertiary/University adjusted OR 3.04, 95% CI 1.12-8.21).

Problem:
Are sports medicine journals relevant and applicable to practitioners and athletes?

Context:
To examine the evidence base of sports medicine research and assess how relevant and applicable it is to everyday practice. Original research articles, short reports, and case reports published in four major sport and exercise medicine journals were studied and classified according to the main topic of study and type of subjects used. The most common topic was sports science, and very few studies related to the treatment of injuries and medical conditions. The majority of published articles used healthy subjects sampled from the sedentary population, and few studies have been carried out on injured participants.

Follow the specified XML output strictly. Do not deviate.

<reasoning>Step-by-step reasoning combining question and context
1. The context indicates that original research articles, short reports, and case reports from four major sport and exercise medicine journals were analyzed.
2. The analysis showed that the most common topic was sports science, suggesting a focus on theoretical or general aspects rather than practical applications.
3. Very few studies related to the treatment of injuries and medical conditions, indicating a lack of direct applicability to real-world issues.
4. The majority of studies used healthy subjects from the sedentary population, which may not reflect the needs of athletes and sports practitioners who deal with active individuals.
5. Only a few studies were conducted on injured participants, further limiting the relevance and applicability to clinical practice.
6. Despite the focus on sports medicine, the findings suggest a gap between the research published in these journals and the practical needs of practitioners and athletes.
7. Given the lack of direct applicability to treating injuries and medical conditions in active individuals, the relevance and applicability of these sports medicine journals to practitioners and athletes are questionable.</reasoning>
Answer: maybe

The reasoning indicates that while some relevance exists due to the general focus on sports science, the majority of studies do not address the specific needs of

Problem:
The clinical significance of bile duct sludge: is it different from bile duct stones?

Context:
Some patients with suspected common bile duct (CBD) stones are found to have sludge and no stones. Although sludge in the gallbladder is a precursor of gallbladder stones, the significance of bile duct sludge (BDS) is poorly defined. This study aimed to compare BDS with bile duct stones in terms of frequency, associated risk factors, and clinical outcome after endoscopic therapy. The study enrolled 228 patients who underwent therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for suspected choledocholithiasis. The patients were divided into two groups: patients with BDS but no stones on ERCP and patients with CBD stones. The presence of risk factors for bile duct stones (age, periampullary diverticulum, ductal dilation or angulation, previous open cholecystectomy) were assessed at ERCP. Follow-up data (36 +/- 19 months) were obtained from medical records and by patient questioning. Bile duct sludge occurred in 14% (31/228) of patients and was more common in females. After endoscopic clearance, CBD stones recurred in 17% (33/197) of the patients with CBD stones, and in 16% (5/31) of the patients with BDS (p = 0.99). Common bile duct dilation was less common in the sludge group. The other known risk factors for recurrent CBD stones (age, previous open cholecystectomy, bile duct angulation, and the presence of a peripampullary diverticulum) were not statistically different between the two groups.

<analysis>
In this context, we are presented with a study that compares bile duct sludge (BDS) and bile duct stones (BDS and CBD stones) in patients undergoing therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for suspected choledocholithiasis. Key facts include:

1. Bile duct sludge was present in 14% of the 228 patients (31 out of 228).
2. Bile duct sludge was more common in females.
3. After endoscopic clearance, there was no significant difference in recurrence rates between patients with bile duct stones (17%) and those with bile duct sludge (16%), as indicated by the p-value of 0.99.
4. Common bile duct dilation was less common in the sludge group.
5. Other known risk factors for recurrent CBD stones (age, previous open cholecystectomy, bile duct angulation, and the presence of a peripampullary diverticulum) did not show statistical differences between the two groups.

There are no direct contradictions within the information provided; however, the study does not definitively state whether bile duct sludge has

Problem:
Is vancomycin MIC creep a worldwide phenomenon?

Context:
Vancomycin is the primary treatment for infections caused by methicilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The association of vancomycin treatment failures with increased vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is a well-recognized problem. A number of single-centre studies have identified progressive increases in glycopeptide MICs for S. aureus strains over recent years - a phenomenon known as vancomycin MIC creep. It is unknown if this is a worldwide phenomenon or if it is localized to specific centers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the trend of vancomycin MIC for isolates of MRSA over a 3-year period in a tertiary university hospital in Portugal. MRSA isolates from samples of patients admitted from January 2007 to December 2009 were assessed. Etest method was used to determine the respective vancomycin MIC. Only one isolate per patient was included in the final analysis. A total of 93 MRSA isolates were studied. The vancomycin MICs were 0.75, 1, 1.5 and 2 mg/L for 1 (1.1%), 19 (20.4%), 38 (40.9%), 35 (37.6%) isolates, respectively. During the 3 year period, we observed a significant fluctuation in the rate of MRSA with a vancomycin MIC > 1 mg/L (2007: 86.2%; 2008: 93.3%; 2009: 58.8%, p = 0.002). No MRSA isolate presented a MIC > 2 mg/L.

Problem:
Is vitamin D deficiency a feature of pediatric celiac disease?

Context:
Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy characterized by villus atrophy and malabsorption of essential nutrients. Vitamin D deficiency has been described in autoimmune diseases, but its status in prepubertal children with CD has not been adequately studied. To determine the vitamin D status of prepubertal children with CD. A retrospective study of prepubertal children aged 3-12 years with CD (n=24) who were compared to prepubertal, non-CD children of the same age (n=50). Children were included in the study if they had a diagnosis of CD by intestinal biopsy, and were not on a gluten-free diet (GFD). Patients were excluded if they had diseases of calcium or vitamin D metabolism, or were receiving calcium or vitamin D supplementation or had other autoimmune diseases. All subjects had their serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level measured. There was no difference in 25(OH)D level between the CD and non-CD children (27.58 +/- 9.91 versus 26.20 +/- 10.45, p = 0.59). However, when the patients were subdivided into obese and non-obese groups, the non-obese CD patients had a significantly higher 25(OH)D level than the obese normal children (28.39 +/- 10.26 versus 21.58 +/- 5.67, p = 0.009). In contrast, there was no difference in 25(OH)D level between non-obese CD patients and non-obese normal children (28.39 +/- 10.26 versus 30.64 +/-12.08, p = 0.52). The season of 25(OH)D measurement was not a significant confounder (p =0.7).

Problem:
Do "America's Best Hospitals" perform better for acute myocardial infarction?

Context:
"America's Best Hospitals," an influential list published annually by U.S. News and World Report, assesses the quality of hospitals. It is not known whether patients admitted to hospitals ranked at the top in cardiology have lower short-term mortality from acute myocardial infarction than those admitted to other hospitals or whether differences in mortality are explained by differential use of recommended therapies. Using data from the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project on 149,177 elderly Medicare beneficiaries with acute myocardial infarction in 1994 or 1995, we examined the care and outcomes of patients admitted to three types of hospitals: those ranked high in cardiology (top-ranked hospitals); hospitals not in the top rank that had on-site facilities for cardiac catheterization, coronary angioplasty, and bypass surgery (similarly equipped hospitals); and the remaining hospitals (non-similarly equipped hospitals). We compared 30-day mortality; the rates of use of aspirin, beta-blockers, and reperfusion; and the relation of differences in rates of therapy to short-term mortality. Admission to a top-ranked hospital was associated with lower adjusted 30-day mortality (odds ratio, 0.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.76 to 1.00; P=0.05 for top-ranked hospitals vs. the others). Among patients without contraindications to therapy, top-ranked hospitals had significantly higher rates of use of aspirin (96.2 percent, as compared with 88.6 percent for similarly equipped hospitals and 83.4 percent for non-similarly equipped hospitals; P<0.01) and beta-blockers (75.0 percent vs. 61.8 percent and 58.7 percent, P<0.01), but lower rates of reperfusion therapy (61.0 percent vs. 70.7 percent and 65.6 percent, P=0.03). The survival advantage associated with admission to top-ranked hospitals was less strong after we adjusted for factors including the use of aspirin and beta-blockers (odds ratio, 0.94; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.08; P=0.38).

Problem:
Preoperative locoregional staging of gastric cancer: is there a place for magnetic resonance imaging?

Context:
The aim of this study was to prospectively compare the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in the preoperative locoregional staging of gastric cancer. This study had Institutional Review Board approval, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Fifty-two patients with biopsy-proven gastric cancer underwent preoperative 1.5-T MRI, 64-channel MDCT and EUS. All images were analysed blind, and the results were compared with histopathological findings according to the seventh edition of the TNM classification. After the population had been divided on the basis of the local invasion (T1-3 vs T4a-b) and nodal involvement (N0 vs N+), sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and accuracy were calculated and diagnostic performance measures were assessed using the McNemar test. For T staging, EUS showed higher sensitivity (94%) than MDCT and MRI (65 and 76%; p = 0.02 and p = 0.08). MDCT and MRI had significantly higher specificity (91 and 89%) than EUS (60%) (p = 0.0009 and p = 0.003). Adding MRI to MDCT or EUS did not result in significant differences for sensitivity. For N staging, EUS showed higher sensitivity (92%) than MRI and MDCT (69 and 73%; p = 0.01 and p = 0.02). MDCT showed better specificity (81%) than EUS and MRI (58 and 73%; p = 0.03 and p = 0.15).

<reasoning>Step-by-step reasoning combining question and context</reasoning>
MRI has been compared with MDCT and EUS in a prospective study of 52 patients with gastric cancer for its diagnostic performance in preoperative locoregional staging. The study evaluated the performance of MRI for both T (local invasion) and N (nodal involvement) staging. For T staging, MRI showed a sensitivity of 76%, which was lower than EUS's sensitivity of 94%. However, MRI had a higher specificity of 89% compared to EUS's 60%. For N staging, MRI had a sensitivity of 69%, again lower than EUS's 92%, but MRI had a higher specificity of 73% compared to EUS's 58%. When considering the overall accuracy, while EUS performed better for N staging, MRI showed high specificity for T staging. The addition of MRI to either MDCT or EUS did not significantly improve sensitivity. The study also found that MDCT had the highest specificity for T

Problem:
Are acceptance rates of a national preventive home visit programme for older people socially imbalanced?

Context:
Preventive home visits are offered to community dwelling older people in Denmark aimed at maintaining their functional ability for as long as possible, but only two thirds of older people accept the offer from the municipalities. The purpose of this study is to investigate 1) whether socioeconomic status was associated with acceptance of preventive home visits among older people and 2) whether municipality invitational procedures for the preventive home visits modified the association. The study population included 1,023 community dwelling 80-year-old individuals from the Danish intervention study on preventive home visits. Information on preventive home visit acceptance rates was obtained from questionnaires. Socioeconomic status was measured by financial assets obtained from national registry data, and invitational procedures were identified through the municipalities. Logistic regression analyses were used, adjusted by gender. Older persons with high financial assets accepted preventive home visits more frequently than persons with low assets (adjusted OR = 1.5 (CI95%: 1.1-2.0)). However, the association was attenuated when adjusted by the invitational procedures. The odds ratio for accepting preventive home visits was larger among persons with low financial assets invited by a letter with a proposed date than among persons with high financial assets invited by other procedures, though these estimates had wide confidence intervals.

If, and how, circumferences, including waist circumference (WC) and hip circumference (HC), scale to height remains unclear, but this is an important consideration when developing normative ranges or applying WC/height and HC/height as risk indexes. The study aim was to examine the scaling of weight, WC, and HC to height in NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) III participants. Subjects were adult non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican American men (n = 7422) and nonpregnant women (n = 7999) who had complete demographic and anthropometric data. In addition to height, allometric models were developed for each measure that controlled for age, race, and self-reported health status. After adjustment for age and race, weight scaled to height in men and women with mean (±SEE) powers of 2.29 ± 0.11 and 1.80 ± 0.07, respectively (both P<0.001). Although univariate circumference-height models were weak or nonsignificant, when adjusted for age and race WC and HC scaled to height with powers of 0.76 ± 0.08 and 0.45 ± 0.05, respectively, in men and 0.80 ± 0.05 and 0.53 ± 0.04, respectively, in women (all P<0.001). Age- and race-adjusted incremental increases in circumferences ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 cm per centimeter increase in height. Both WC/height and HC/height scaled negatively to height in men and women, and WC/HC scaled negatively to height in women only (all P<0.001). Health status-adjusted models were similar.

Follow the specified XML output strictly. The provided context talks about the relationship between various body measurements (weight, waist circumference, and hip circumference) and height in a specific population (NHANES III participants). It mentions that weight scales with height squared, while waist and hip circumferences do not scale as strongly, but still show some association with height when adjusted for age and race.

<analysis>Key facts:
- Weight scales with height squared (weight/height^2).
- Waist circumference (WC) and hip circumference (HC) do not scale as strongly to height.
- Adjusted models for age and race show that both WC and HC have positive scaling relationships with height, though weaker than weight.
- There is a slight increase in circumferences for every centimeter increase in height (incremental increase from 0.2 to 0.5 cm per cm height).
- Waist-to-hip ratio (WC/HC) and waist-to-height ratio (WC/height) scale negatively with height, indicating that taller individuals tend to have lower ratios.
- The study was conducted on a specific group (adult non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican American men and women from NHANES III).

Contradictions:

Problem:
Can third trimester ultrasound predict the presentation of the first twin at delivery?

Context:
To determine the ability of early sonogram to predict the presentation of twin A at birth. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on all twin pregnancies evaluated at our Fetal Evaluation Unit from 2007 to 2009. Sonogram records were reviewed for the presentation of twin A at seven gestational age intervals and inpatient medical records were reviewed for the presentation of twin A at delivery. The positive predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity of presentation as determined by ultrasound, at each gestational age interval, for the same presentation at delivery were calculated. Two hundred and thirty-eight twin pregnancies met inclusion criteria. A total of 896 ultrasounds were reviewed. The positive predictive value of cephalic presentation of twin A as determined by ultrasound for the persistence of cephalic presentation at delivery reached 95% after 28 weeks gestation. The positive predictive value for noncephalic presentation as established by sonogram for noncephalic at delivery was>90% after 32 weeks gestation.

Problem:
Should tumor depth be included in prognostication of soft tissue sarcoma?

Context:
Most staging systems for soft tissue sarcoma are based on histologic malignancy-grade, tumor size and tumor depth. These factors are generally dichotomized, size at 5 cm. We believe it is unlikely that tumor depth per se should influence a tumor's metastatic capability. Therefore we hypothesized that the unfavourable prognostic importance of depth could be explained by the close association between size and depth, deep-seated tumors on average being larger than the superficial ones. When tumor size is dichotomized, this effect should be most pronounced in the large size (>5 cm) group in which the size span is larger. We analyzed the associations between tumor size and depth and the prognostic importance of grade, size and depth in a population-based series of 490 adult patients with soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity or trunk wall with complete, 4.5 years minimum, follow-up. Multivariate analysis showed no major prognostic effect of tumor depth when grade and size were taken into account. The mean size of small tumors was the same whether superficial or deep but the mean size of large and deep-seated tumors were one third larger than that of large but superficial tumors. Tumor depth influenced the prognosis in the subset of high-grade and large tumors. In this subset deep-seated tumors had poorer survival rate than superficial tumors, which could be explained by the larger mean size of the deep-seated tumors.

Problem:
Could ESC (Electronic Stability Control) change the way we drive?

Context:
ESC (Electronic Stability Control) is a crash avoidance technology that reduces the likelihood of collisions involving loss of control. Although past and emerging research indicates that ESC is effective in reducing collision rates and saving lives, and its inclusion in all vehicle platforms is encouraged, drivers may demonstrate behavioral adaptation or an overreliance on ESC that could offset or reduce its overall effectiveness. The main objective of the present study was to determine whether behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely to occur upon the widespread introduction of ESC into the Canadian vehicle fleet. Secondary objectives were to confirm the results of a previous ESC public survey and to generate a baseline measure for the future assessment of planned and ongoing ESC promotional activities in Canada. Two separate telephone surveys evaluated drivers' perceptions and awareness of ESC. The first surveyed 500 randomly selected owners/drivers of passenger vehicles. The second surveyed 1017 owners/drivers of 2006-2008 ESC-equipped passenger vehicles from the provinces of Quebec and British Columbia, Canada. Though ESC drivers were much more likely than drivers of other vehicles to be aware of ESC (77% vs. 39%) and that their own vehicle was equipped with it (63% vs. 8%), 23 percent had never heard of it. Ninety percent of drivers who knew that their vehicle was equipped with ESC believed that ESC had made it safer to drive and reported being confident that ESC would work in an emergency. Twenty-three percent of ESC owners who knew their vehicle had ESC reported noticing long-lasting changes in their driving behavior since they began driving the vehicle.

<xml>
<reasoning>Rationale for the answer based on the context provided.</reasoning>
 Answer: maybe <xml>

The study provides insights into driver behaviors and awareness related to ESC. While it shows that drivers are becoming aware of ESC and believe it makes driving safer, there is also evidence of behavioral changes due to reliance on this technology. This suggests that ESC could indeed alter how people drive, but the extent and nature of these changes remain somewhat ambiguous and could vary depending on individual circumstances and further research outcomes. Therefore, the answer is "maybe," indicating that while there is potential for ESC to change driving behaviors, the full impact is not definitively known based on the current information.

Problem:
Does patient position during liver surgery influence the risk of venous air embolism?

Context:
It is generally believed that positioning of the patient in a head-down tilt (Trendelenberg position) decreases the likelihood of a venous air embolism during liver resection. The physiological effect of variation in horizontal attitude on central and hepatic venous pressure was measured in 10 patients during liver surgery. Hemodynamic indices were recorded with the operating table in the horizontal, 20 degrees head-up and 20 degrees head-down positions. There was no demonstrable pressure gradient between the hepatic and central venous levels in any of the positions. The absolute pressures did, however, vary in a predictable way, being highest in the head-down and lowest during head-up tilt. However, on no occasion was a negative intraluminal pressure recorded.

Problem:
Have antiepileptic drug prescription claims changed following the FDA suicidality warning?

Context:
In January 2008, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) communicated concerns and, in May 2009, issued a warning about an increased risk of suicidality for all antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). This research evaluated the association between the FDA suicidality communications and the AED prescription claims among members with epilepsy and/or psychiatric disorder. A longitudinal interrupted time-series design was utilized to evaluate Oklahoma Medicaid claims data from January 2006 through December 2009. The study included 9289 continuously eligible members with prevalent diagnoses of epilepsy and/or psychiatric disorder and at least one AED prescription claim. Trends, expressed as monthly changes in the log odds of AED prescription claims, were compared across three time periods: before (January 2006 to January 2008), during (February 2008 to May 2009), and after (June 2009 to December 2009) the FDA warning. Before the FDA warning period, a significant upward trend of AED prescription claims of 0.01% per month (99% CI: 0.008% to 0.013%, p<0.0001) was estimated. In comparison to the prewarning period, no significant change in trend was detected during (-20.0%, 99% CI: -70.0% to 30.0%, p=0.34) or after (80.0%, 99% CI: -20.0% to 200.0%, p=0.03) the FDA warning period. After stratification, no diagnostic group (i.e., epilepsy alone, epilepsy and comorbid psychiatric disorder, and psychiatric disorder alone) experienced a significant change in trend during the entire study period (p>0.01).

<analysis>Analysis of the context and key facts</analysis>
Answer: maybe

The context discusses the comparison between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians regarding aging and health conditions, specifically addressing the premise that Indigenous Australians might age prematurely. The study focuses on life expectancy and the prevalence of certain health conditions across different age groups.

Key facts extracted from the context include:
1. At age 63 for women and age 65 for men, Indigenous people have the same life expectancy as non-Indigenous people at age 70.
2. There is no consistent pattern indicating a 20-year lead in age-specific prevalence of age-associated conditions for Indigenous Australians compared to non-Indigenous Australians.
3. From middle age onwards, there is high prevalence of some conditions, particularly diabetes, but this does not necessarily indicate premature aging.

The context suggests that while Indigenous Australians may experience higher rates of certain conditions at younger ages, it does not definitively prove that they age prematurely. The statement about life expectancy at specific ages aligns more with a similar aging process rather than premature aging.

Problem:
Is intensive chemotherapy safe for rural cancer patients?

Context:
To provide equality of cancer care to rural patients, Townsville Cancer Centre administers intensive chemotherapy regimens to rural patients with node-positive breast and metastatic colorectal cancers at the same doses as urban patients. Side-effects were usually managed by rural general practitioners locally.AIM: The aim is to determine the safety of this practice by comparing the profile of serious adverse events and dose intensities between urban and rural patients at the Townsville Cancer Centre. A retrospective audit was conducted in patients with metastatic colorectal and node-positive breast cancers during a 24-month period. Fisher's exact test was used for analysis. Rurality was determined as per rural, remote and metropolitan classification. Of the 121 patients included, 70 and 51 patients had breast and colon cancers respectively. The urban versus rural patient split among all patients, breast and colorectal cancer subgroups was 68 versus 53, 43 versus 27 and 25 versus 26 respectively. A total of 421 cycles was given with dose intensity of>95% for breast cancer in both groups (P>0.05). Rate of febrile neutropenia was 9.3% versus 7.4% (P = 0.56). For XELOX, rate of diarrhoea was 20% versus 19% (P = 0.66) and rate of vomiting was 20% versus 11% (P = 0.11). Only two patients were transferred to Townsville for admission. No toxic death occurred in either group.

Problem:
Are high flow nasal cannulae noisier than bubble CPAP for preterm infants?

Context:
Noise exposure in the neonatal intensive care unit is believed to be a risk factor for hearing loss in preterm neonates. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices exceed recommended noise levels. High flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) are an increasingly popular alternative to CPAP for treating preterm infants, but there are no in vivo studies assessing noise production by HFNC. To study whether HFNC are noisier than bubble CPAP (BCPAP) for preterm infants. An observational study of preterm infants receiving HFNC or BCPAP. Noise levels within the external auditory meatus (EAM) were measured using a microphone probe tube connected to a calibrated digital dosimeter. Noise was measured across a range of frequencies and reported as decibels A-weighted (dBA). A total of 21 HFNC and 13 BCPAP noise measurements were performed in 21 infants. HFNC gas flows were 2-5 L/min, and BCPAP gas flows were 6-10 L/min with set pressures of 5-7 cm of water. There was no evidence of a difference in average noise levels measured at the EAM: mean difference (95% CI) of -1.6 (-4.0 to 0.9) dBA for HFNC compared to BCPAP. At low frequency (500 Hz), HFNC was mean (95% CI) 3.0 (0.3 to 5.7) dBA quieter than BCPAP. Noise increased with increasing BCPAP gas flow (p=0.007), but not with increasing set pressure. There was a trend to noise increasing with increasing HFNC gas flows.

Problem:
Hepatorenal syndrome: are we missing some prognostic factors?

Context:
Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is the functional renal failure associated with advanced cirrhosis and has also been described in fulminant hepatic failure. Without liver transplantation its prognosis is dismal. Our study included patients with type 1 HRS associated with cirrhosis, who were not liver transplant candidates.AIM: To identify variables associated with improved survival. Sixty-eight patients fulfilled the revised Ascites Club Criteria for type 1 HRS. None of them was suitable for liver transplantation. All the patients were treated with combinations of: albumin, midodrine and octreotide, pressors, and hemodialysis. Median survival was 13 days for the whole group. Survival varied with the end-stage liver disease (ESLD) etiology: autoimmune, 49 days, cardiac cirrhosis, 22 days, idiopathic, 15.5 days, viral, 15 days, hepatitis C and alcohol, 14.5 days, alcohol 8 days, and neoplasia 4 days (p = 0.048). Survival of HRS associated with alcoholic liver disease versus other etiologies was not statistically significant (p = 0.1). Increased serum creatinine (p = 0.02) and urinary sodium 6-10 mEq/l (p = 0.027) at the initiation of therapy were prognostic factors for mortality. HRS treatment modalities (p = 0.73), use of dialysis (p = 0.56), dialysis modality (p = 0.35), use of vasopressors (p = 0.26), pre-existing renal disease (p = 0.49), gender (p = 0.90), and age (p = 0.57) were not associated with survival.

<abstract>
<p>Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a condition where kidney function deteriorates in patients with severe liver disease. It's particularly problematic in those who cannot undergo liver transplantation. The study looked at 68 patients diagnosed with type 1 HRS due to cirrhosis, excluding those eligible for liver transplant. Treatment involved a combination of medical interventions such as albumin, midodrine, octreotide, and hemodialysis. Despite these treatments, median survival was only 13 days. The study found that the type of underlying liver disease could influence survival, with autoimmune cirrhosis having the best survival rate and alcoholic cirrhosis the worst. Additionally, higher initial serum creatinine levels and lower urinary sodium levels were linked to increased risk of death.</p>

Problem:
Treadmill testing of children who have spina bifida and are ambulatory: does peak oxygen uptake reflect maximum oxygen uptake?

Context:
Earlier studies have demonstrated low peak oxygen uptake ((.)Vo(2)peak) in children with spina bifida. Low peak heart rate and low peak respiratory exchange ratio in these studies raised questions regarding the true maximal character of (.)Vo(2)peak values obtained with treadmill testing. The aim of this study was to determine whether the Vo(2)peak measured during an incremental treadmill test is a true reflection of the maximum oxygen uptake ((.)Vo(2)max) in children who have spina bifida and are ambulatory. A cross-sectional design was used for this study. Twenty children who had spina bifida and were ambulatory participated. The (.)Vo(2)peak was measured during a graded treadmill exercise test. The validity of (.)Vo(2)peak measurements was evaluated by use of previously described guidelines for maximum exercise testing in children who are healthy, as well as differences between Vo(2)peak and (.)Vo(2) during a supramaximal protocol ((.)Vo(2)supramaximal). The average values for (.)Vo(2)peak and normalized (.)Vo(2)peak were, respectively, 1.23 L/min (SD=0.6) and 34.1 mL/kg/min (SD=8.3). Fifteen children met at least 2 of the 3 previously described criteria; one child failed to meet any criteria. Although there were no significant differences between (.)Vo(2)peak and Vo(2)supramaximal, 5 children did show improvement during supramaximal testing. These results apply to children who have spina bifida and are at least community ambulatory.

The context discusses a study conducted to investigate whether the peak oxygen uptake ((.)Vo(2)peak) measured during an incremental treadmill test accurately reflects the maximum oxygen uptake ((.)Vo(2)max) in children with spina bifida who can walk independently (ambulatory). Key findings include:

- Twenty children with spina bifida and ambulatory ability participated.
- (.)Vo(2)peak averaged 1.23 L/min with a standard deviation of 0.6, and 34.1 mL/kg/min with a standard deviation of 8.3.
- Fifteen out of twenty children met at least two of three previously described criteria for reaching (.)Vo(2)max.
- Although there were no significant differences between (.)Vo(2)peak and (.)Vo(2)supramaximal, five children showed improvement during supramaximal testing.

The context suggests that, for the majority of the participants, the (.)Vo(2)peak measured during the incremental treadmill test could be considered a reflection of

Problem:
Can pictorial warning labels on cigarette packages address smoking-related health disparities?

Context:
The objective of this study was to determine the most effective content of pictorial health warning labels (HWLs) and whether educational attainment moderates these effects. Field experiments were conducted with 529 adult smokers and 530 young adults (258 nonsmokers; 271 smokers). Participants reported responses to different pictorial HWLs printed on cigarette packages. One experiment involved manipulating textual form (testimonial narrative vs. didactic) and the other involved manipulating image type (diseased organs vs. human suffering). Tests of mean ratings and rankings indicated that pictorial HWLs with didactic textual forms had equivalent or significantly higher credibility, relevance, and impact than pictorial HWLs with testimonial forms. Results from mixed-effects models confirmed these results. However, responses differed by participant educational attainment: didactic forms were consistently rated higher than testimonials among participants with higher education, whereas the difference between didactic and testimonial narrative forms was weaker or not statistically significant among participants with lower education. In the second experiment, with textual content held constant, greater credibility, relevance, and impact was found for graphic imagery of diseased organs than imagery of human suffering.

Problem:
The HELPP syndrome--evidence of a possible systemic inflammatory response in pre-eclampsia?

Context:
The principal causes of morbidity and mortality during pregnancy in Mexico, are preeclampsia/eclampsia, obstetric hemorrhage and puerperium complications; this is, 62% of maternal deaths in last years. HELLP syndrome was observed between 5 to 25% of the mortality in pregnancies of 36 weeks or less. To analyze patients with HELLP syndrome in ICU's (Intensive Care Unit) of a Gynecology and Obstetric Hospital, related to the abnormal hematological, hepatic and renal results with the obstetric case history and the clinical complications. A transversal study in patients with HELLP syndrome during 1998 and 1999 were carry out. Peripheral blood with Microangiopathic hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes: AST, ALT over 40 UI/L, even when were LDH lower than 600 UI/L. It was evaluated the hepatic and renal function, platelets count, microangiopathic hemolysis, arterial pressure, seizures, icteric skin color, blindness, visual disturbances, nausea, vomiting and upper quadrant right abdominal pain. In newborn we analyzed gestational age, sex, weight and APGAR. We studied for an association between maternal and biochemical variables with Correlation Pearson Test, and dependence between variables with lineal regression model. 2878 patients with hypertensives disorders in pregnancy (11.64%). The 1.15% (n = 33) had HELLP syndrome with specific maternal mortality of 0.4 per 10,000 live birth, perinatal mortality of 1.62 per 10,000 live birth; and renal damage in 84.5%.

Problem:
Aberrant loss of dickkopf-3 in gastric cancer: can it predict lymph node metastasis preoperatively?

Context:
Dickkopf-3 (DKK3) may act as a tumor suppressor as it is down-regulated in various types of cancer. This study assessed the DKK3 protein expression in gastric cancer and its potential value as a prognostic marker. DKK3 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 158 gastric cancer samples from patients who underwent gastrectomy from 2002 to 2008. Clinicopathological parameters and survival data were analyzed. Loss of DKK3 expression was found in 64 of 158 (40.5%) samples, and it was associated with advanced T stage (p<0.001), lymph node metastasis (p<0.001), UICC TNM stage (p<0.001), tumor location (p = 0.029), lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.035), and perineural invasion (p = 0.032). Patients without DKK3 expression in tumor cells had a significantly worse disease-free and overall survival than those with DKK3 expression (p<0.001, and p = 0.001, respectively). TNM stage (p = 0.028 and p<0.001, respectively) and residual tumor (p<0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively) were independent predictors of disease-free and overall survival. Based on the preoperative clinical stage assessed by computed tomography (CT), loss of DKK3 expression was predominantly associated with worse prognosis in patients with clinically node-negative advanced gastric cancer (AGC). The combination of DKK3 expression status and CT increased the accuracy of CT staging for predicting lymph node involvement from 71.5 to 80.0% in AGC patients.

<question>Can the loss of DKK3 predict lymph node metastasis preoperatively in gastric cancer?</question>
Answer: maybe

<analysis>Dickkopf-3 (DKK3) is down-regulated in gastric cancer and its loss is associated with advanced T stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor survival outcomes. Preoperatively, the loss of DKK3 expression is predominantly associated with worse prognosis in patients with clinically node-negative advanced gastric cancer, thereby improving the accuracy of CT staging for predicting lymph node involvement. However, the evidence suggests that while DKK3 loss is linked to lymph node metastasis, it does not definitively prove its role as an independent predictor in all cases, especially in early-stage tumors.</analysis> Answer: maybe

The analysis reveals that DKK3 loss is correlated with lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis, but its predictive power for lymph node metastasis preoperatively is contingent on additional factors such as clinical staging and residual tumor status. Therefore, the evidence is suggestive but not conclusive, warranting a "maybe" answer. Answer: maybe

The frequency of men and women exposed to ionizing radiation through work in a nuclear power plant among 270 infertile couples was retrospectively compared to a control fertile population using a pair-matched analysis. The total cumulative equivalent radiation dose was determined. In addition, the spermiograms of the male partners in both groups were compared and correlated to the degree of exposure. No differences were noted in the frequency of nuclear power plant exposure between sterile and fertile groups. There was a higher rate of anomalous spermiograms in nuclear power plant workers. However, abnormalities were temporary. No correlation was found between the cumulative equivalent radiation dose and abnormal spermiograms.

A control group of 92 athletesfrom without ventricular arrhythmias was randomly seleclted from the database (group C). Of the 192 athletes 39 returnied for a repeat exercise test after a mean follow-up period of 70 +/- 25 months and they constitute the study population. Twelve athletes from group A, 21 fromgroup B and 6 from group C returned for a repeat exercise test. The athletes reached a significantly lower peak heart rate during their follow-up exercise test (P = 0.001). More athletes were engaged in competitive sports during their initialexercise test than in the follow-up test (P = 0.021). Most of theathletes who had VPB and/orventricular couplets and/or NSVT during their initial exercise test had far fewer ventricular arrhythmias in the follow-up exercise test (P = 0.001).

Problem:
Is the type of remission after a major depressive episode an important risk factor to relapses in a 4-year follow up?

Context:
Rates of relapse and predictive relapse factors were studied over more than 4 years in a sample of Spanish outpatients with DSM-III-R criteria for unipolar major depressive episode. A final sample of 139 outpatient was followed monthly in a naturalistic study. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R was used. Phases of evolution were recorded using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, applying the Frank criteria. Survival analysis, Kaplan-Meier product limit and proportional hazards models were used. A higher rate of relapses was observed in the partial remission group (91.4%) compared to the complete remission one (51.3%). The four factors with predictive relapse value were: "partial remission versus complete remission", "the intensity of clinical symptoms", "the age" and "the number of previous depressive episodes". The existence of partial remission was the most powerful predictive factor. The decreasing sample size during the follow-up and the difficulty in warranting the treatment compliance.
