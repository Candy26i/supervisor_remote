[Sub-agent Response]
Key facts:
1. A cross-sectional study evaluated the impact of a physician's specialty on the frequency and depth of medication history documented in patient medical records.
2. The study involved 123 physicians and 900 randomly selected patients from various specialties (Cardiology, Chest, Dermatology, Endocrine, Gastroenterology, Haematology, Neurology, Psychiatry, and Renal).
3. There were more female patients than male patients (50.8% vs 49.2%), with mean ages of 43.2 and 43.1 years, respectively.
4. Physicians' specialties significantly influenced both the depth and frequency of the medication history information documented in the medical records (p-values < 0.0001).
5. Specific specialties (Cardiology, Chest, Gastroenterology, Psychiatry, and Endocrine) showed differences in documenting certain aspects of the medication history, such as adverse drug reactions, adherence, allergies, alcohol use, and dietary restrictions.

No contradictions are found in the given context.

Relevance to the question:
The context directly addresses the question by providing evidence that a physician's specialty does influence the recording of medication history in patients' case notes, both in terms of depth and frequency

The anal sphincter became paradoxically shorter and/or thicker during straining (versus the resting state) in 85% of patients but in only 35% of control subjects. Changes in sphincter length were statistically significantly different (p<0.01, chi(2) test) in patients compared with control subjects.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether sublingual varices are related to presence of hypertension. In an observational clinical study among 431 dental patients tongue status and blood pressure were documented. Digital photographs of the lateral borders of the tongue for grading of sublingual varices were taken, and blood pressure was measured. Those patients without previous diagnosis of hypertension and with a noted blood pressure â‰¥ 140 mmHg and/or â‰¥ 90 mmHg at the dental clinic performed complementary home blood pressure during one week. Those with an average home blood pressure â‰¥ 135 mmHg and/or â‰¥ 85 mmHg were referred to the primary health care centre, where three office blood pressure measurements were taken with one week intervals. Two independent blinded observers studied the photographs of the tongues. Each photograph was graded as none/few (grade 0) or medium/severe (grade 1) presence of sublingual varices. Pearson's Chi-square test, Student's t-test, and multiple regression analysis were applied. Power calculation stipulated a study population of 323 patients. An association between sublingual varices and hypertension was found (OR = 2.25, p<0.002). Mean systolic blood pressure was 123 and 132 mmHg in patients with grade 0 and grade 1 sublingual varices, respectively (p<0.0001, CI 95 %). Mean diastolic blood pressure was 80 and 83 mmHg in patients with grade 0 and grade 1 sublingual varices, respectively (p<0.005, CI 95 %). Sublingual varices indicate hypertension with a positive predictive value of 0.5 and a negative predictive value of 0.80.\n\nPlease choose ONE next agent to call from: question_understanding, context_analysis, reasoning, answering.\n\nReply STRICTLY in the form:\nAgent: <name>\nThen explain why.\n\nREMEMBER: Only output the agent name and one brief explanation sentence.
