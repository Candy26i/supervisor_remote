[Sub-agent Response]
analysis:
The context discusses the use of CA72-4 as a potential biomarker to differentiate between ovarian endometrioma and epithelial ovarian cancer. It highlights that CA125, another commonly used biomarker, is not reliable due to its high levels in both conditions. The study compared CA125 and CA72-4 levels in two groups: 72 patients with ovarian endometriomas and 55 patients with ovarian cancer. The results showed that while both markers had elevated levels in both conditions, there was a significant difference in CA72-4 levels, with higher values observed in ovarian cancer patients compared to endometrioma patients.

Key facts:
- CA72-4 is being evaluated as a potential biomarker for differentiating ovarian endometrioma from epithelial ovarian cancer.
- CA125 is not a reliable biomarker for differentiation as it shows high levels in both conditions.
- In the study, CA125 was elevated in both ovarian endometriomas and ovarian cancer.
- CA72-4 showed a marked difference between ovarian cancer and endometrioma patients, with significantly higher levels in cancer patients.

No contradictions are present in the given context.

Longitudinal review of admissions data relating to students entering dental education at the University of Otago, New Zealand, between 2004 and 2009 was compared with academic performance throughout the dental programme. After controlling for variables, pre-admission academic average, UMAT scores and interview performance did not predict performance as a dental student. Class place in second year, however, was a strong predictor of class place in final year. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the best predictors of higher class placement in the final year were New Zealand European ethnicity and domestic (rather than international) student status. Other socio-demographic characteristics were not associated with performance. These interim findings provide a sound base for the ongoing study.\n\nPlease choose ONE next agent to call from: question_understanding, context_analysis, reasoning, answering.\n\nReply STRICTLY in the form:\nAgent: <name>\nThen explain why.\n\nREMEMBER: Only output the agent name and one brief explanation sentence.

This paper describes the results of our study on the effects of breast-feeding on rate of illness in normal children with a family history of atopy. A historic cohort approach of 794 children with a family history of atopy was used to assess the effects of breast-feeding on illness rates. Family history of atopy was based on allergic diseases in family members as registered by the family physician. Illness data from birth onwards were available from the Continuous Morbidity Registration of the Department of Family Medicine. Information on breast-feeding was collected by postal questionnaire. We then compared rates of illness between children with a family history of atopy who were and who were not breast-fed. Breast-feeding was related to lower levels of childhood illness both in the first and the first three years of life. In the first year of life they had fewer episodes of gastroenteritis, lower respiratory tract infections, and digestive tract disorders. Over the next three years of life they had fewer respiratory tract infections and skin infections.\n\nPlease choose ONE next agent to call from: question_understanding, context_analysis, reasoning, answering.\n\nReply STRICTLY in the form:\nAgent: <name>\nThen explain why.\n\nREMEMBER: Only output the agent name and one brief explanation sentence.

All available preoperative contrast enemas (n = 61) had been single blind reviewed by the same radiologist who defined the radiographic transition zone when present in vertebral level. Four groups were determined (rectal, rectosigmoid, long segment, and absence of transition zone) and by Kappa coefficient of agreement correlated to the length of aganglionosis in the pathological report. Radiological findings were concordant with the specimen in pathology in 8 cases of 19 in rectal form (42 %), in 20 cases of 35 in rectosigmoid form (57 %), in all 6 cases of long-segment form (100 %), in the 2 cases of total colonic form (100 %) with a global agreement of 58.1 %, κ = 0.39 CI [0.24; 0.57].\n\nPlease choose ONE next agent to call from: question_understanding, context_analysis, reasoning, answering.\n\nReply STRICTLY in the form:\nAgent: <name>\nThen explain why.\n\nREMEMBER: Only output the agent name and one brief explanation sentence.
