analysis:
The context discusses the use of CA72-4 as a potential biomarker to differentiate between ovarian endometrioma and epithelial ovarian cancer. It highlights that CA125, another commonly used biomarker, is not reliable due to its high levels in both conditions. The study compared CA125 and CA72-4 levels in two groups: 72 patients with ovarian endometriomas and 55 patients with ovarian cancer. The results showed that while both markers had elevated levels in both conditions, there was a significant difference in CA72-4 levels, with higher values observed in ovarian cancer patients compared to endometrioma patients.

Key facts:
- CA72-4 is being evaluated as a potential biomarker for differentiating ovarian endometrioma from epithelial ovarian cancer.
- CA125 is not a reliable biomarker for differentiation as it shows high levels in both conditions.
- In the study, CA125 was elevated in both ovarian endometriomas and ovarian cancer.
- CA72-4 showed a marked difference between ovarian cancer and endometrioma patients, with significantly higher levels in cancer patients.

No contradictions are present in the given context.
