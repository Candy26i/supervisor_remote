Problem:
Does a physician's specialty influence the recording of medication history in patients' case notes?

Context:
To determine the impact of a physician's specialty on the frequency and depth of medication history documented in patient medical records. A cross-sectional assessment of the frequency and depth of medication history information documented by 123 physicians for 900 randomly selected patients stratified across Cardiology, Chest, Dermatology, Endocrine, Gastroenterology, Haematology, Neurology, Psychiatry and Renal specialties was carried out at a 900-bed teaching hospital located in Ibadan, Nigeria. Four hundred and forty-three (49.2%) of the cohort were males and 457 (50.8%) were females; with mean ages 43.2 +/- 18.6 and 43.1 +/- 17.9 years respectively. Physicians' specialties significantly influenced the depth of documentation of the medication history information across the nine specialties (P<0.0001). Post hoc pair-wise comparisons with Tukey's HSD test showed that the mean scores for adverse drug reactions and adherence to medicines was highest in the Cardiology specialty; while the Chest specialty had the highest mean scores for allergy to drugs, food, chemicals and cigarette smoking. Mean scores for the use of alcohol; illicit drugs; dietary restrictions was highest for Gastroenterology, Psychiatry and Endocrine specialties respectively. Physicians' specialties also significantly influenced the frequency of documentation of the medication history across the nine specialties (P<0.0001).

Follow the specified XML output strictly. Use the provided context and problem to generate the output.
<analysis>
The context provides a detailed study on how different physician specialties influence the recording of medication history in patient case notes. Key facts include:

1. The study was conducted at a 900-bed teaching hospital in Ibadan, Nigeria.
2. It involved 123 physicians and 900 randomly selected patients, stratified across various specialties.
3. There was a significant impact of physician specialties on both the depth (P<0.0001) and frequency (P<0.0001) of documentation of medication history.
4. Specific specialties had distinct patterns of documentation, such as:
   - Cardiology: highest in documenting adverse drug reactions and adherence to medicines.
   - Chest: highest in documenting allergies.
   - Gastroenterology: highest in documenting alcohol use.
   - Psychiatry: highest in documenting the use of illicit drugs.
   - Endocrine: highest in documenting dietary restrictions.

There are no explicit contradictions in the given context.
</analysis>
Answer: yes

The context clearly indicates that physician specialties do have an influence on the recording of medication history in patients' case notes, both in terms of depth and frequency. <analysis>

Problem:
Is there a connection between sublingual varices and hypertension?

Context:
Sublingual varices have earlier been related to ageing, smoking and cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to investigate whether sublingual varices are related to presence of hypertension. In an observational clinical study among 431 dental patients tongue status and blood pressure were documented. Digital photographs of the lateral borders of the tongue for grading of sublingual varices were taken, and blood pressure was measured. Those patients without previous diagnosis of hypertension and with a noted blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and/or ≥ 90 mmHg at the dental clinic performed complementary home blood pressure during one week. Those with an average home blood pressure ≥ 135 mmHg and/or ≥ 85 mmHg were referred to the primary health care centre, where three office blood pressure measurements were taken with one week intervals. Two independent blinded observers studied the photographs of the tongues. Each photograph was graded as none/few (grade 0) or medium/severe (grade 1) presence of sublingual varices. Pearson's Chi-square test, Student's t-test, and multiple regression analysis were applied. Power calculation stipulated a study population of 323 patients. An association between sublingual varices and hypertension was found (OR = 2.25, p<0.002). Mean systolic blood pressure was 123 and 132 mmHg in patients with grade 0 and grade 1 sublingual varices, respectively (p<0.0001, CI 95 %). Mean diastolic blood pressure was 80 and 83 mmHg in patients with grade 0 and grade 1 sublingual varices, respectively (p<0.005, CI 95 %). Sublingual varices indicate hypertension with a positive predictive value of 0.5 and a negative predictive value of 0.80.

Key facts extracted from the context include:
1. The study covered a large sample size of 123 physicians and 900 patients.
2. There was a significant influence of physician specialty on the depth of medication history documentation.
3. Specific specialties like Cardiology and Chest specialties had higher scores in certain areas.
4. Each specialty had unique areas where they excelled in documenting medication history.
