<ContextAnalysis>
    <KeyFacts>
        <Fact>Surgical excision of ovarian endometriomas carries a risk of damaging healthy ovarian tissue.</Fact>
        <Fact>A correct diagnosis is crucial to avoid unexpected ovarian cancer misdiagnosis.</Fact>
        <Fact>CA125 levels are high in both ovarian endometriomas and ovarian cancers, making it unsuitable for differentiation.</Fact>
        <Fact>The study aimed to determine if CA72-4 can help differentiate between ovarian endometriosis and epithelial ovarian cancer.</Fact>
        <Fact>In the study, high CA125 concentrations were observed in both conditions (endometriosis and cancer).</Fact>
        <Fact>A significant difference in CA72-4 levels was found between women with ovarian cancer and those with endometriosis.</Fact>
    </KeyFacts>
    <Contradictions>
        <Contradiction>The mention of high CA125 concentrations in both endometriomas and cancers contradicts the assertion that CA125 is not useful for discrimination, but rather indicates its limitations.</Contradiction>
