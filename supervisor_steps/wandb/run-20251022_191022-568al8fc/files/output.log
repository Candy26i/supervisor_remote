The study aimed to explore the relationship between sublingual varices and hypertension by investigating a group of 431 dental patients. The study found a significant association between sublingual varices and hypertension, with an odds ratio of 2.25. Patients with grade 1 sublingual varices had higher mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures compared to those with no or few sublingual varices. The positive predictive value of sublingual varices for hypertension is 0.5, while the negative predictive value is 0.80.</abstract>

<reasoning>To determine if the affinity column-mediated immunoassay (ACMIA) method is suitable as an alternative to the microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA) method for measuring blood tacrolimus concentrations, we need to consider the following points based on the given context:

1. **Correlation Analysis**: The study found that the tacrolimus concentrations measured by the ACMIA method closely correlated with those measured by the MEIA method (r = 0.84). This strong correlation suggests that the two methods produce similar results, which is a positive indicator for the suitability of ACMIA as an alternative to MEIA.

2. **Bland-Altman Plot**: The Bland-Altman plot did not show any specific trends, indicating that there was no systematic bias between the two methods. This further supports the reliability of the ACMIA method in comparison to the MEIA method.

3. **Influence of Hematocrit Levels**: Both the MEIA and ACMIA methods were not influenced by hematocrit levels, which means that the accuracy

1. The question asks about the suitability of affinity column-mediated immunoassay (ACMIA) as an alternative to microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA) for blood tacrolimus assays.

2. The context provides information on a study comparing these two methods for measuring tacrolimus concentrations in whole-blood samples from transplant recipients.

3. Key findings from the study include:
   - Correlation coefficient (r) of 0.84 between ACMIA and MEIA measurements, indicating a strong positive correlation.
   - No specific trends in the Bland-Altman plot, suggesting consistent agreement between the two methods.
   - Neither method's tacrolimus levels were influenced by hematocrit levels.
   - The difference between the two methods tended to be larger in low hematocrit samples, but this was noted without further implication.

4. Considering these points:
   - The strong correlation suggests that ACMIA and MEIA yield similar results under most conditions.
   - The lack of specific trends in the Bland-Altman plot indicates that there is no systematic bias between the methods.

<problem>Is the affinity column-mediated immunoassay method suitable as an alternative to the microparticle enzyme immunoassay method as a blood tacrolimus assay?</problem>
<context>Tacrolimus is a potent immunosuppressive drug used in organ transplantation. Because of its substantial toxic effects, narrow therapeutic index, and interindividual pharmacokinetic variability, therapeutic drug monitoring of whole-blood tacrolimus concentrations has been recommended. We investigated the comparability of the results of 2 immunoassay systems, affinity column-mediated immunoassay (ACMIA) and microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA), comparing differences in the tacrolimus concentrations measured by the 2 methods in relation to the hematologic and biochemical values of hepatic and renal functions. A total of 154 samples from kidney or liver transplant recipients were subjected to Dimension RxL HM with a tacrolimus Flex reagent cartilage for the ACMIA method and IMx tacrolimus II for the MEIA method. Tacrolimus concentrations measured by the ACMIA method (n = 154) closely correlated with those measured by the MEIA method (r = 0.

<reasoning>The affinity column-mediated immunoassay (ACMIA) method was compared to the microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA) method for measuring tacrolimus concentrations in blood samples from kidney or liver transplant recipients. Several key points support the suitability of the ACMIA method as an alternative to the MEIA method:

1. **Correlation**: The tacrolimus concentrations measured by ACMIA and MEIA showed a strong correlation (r = 0.84), indicating that the two methods produce similar results.
2. **No Specific Trends**: The Bland-Altman plot did not show any specific trends, suggesting that there are no systematic biases between the two methods.
3. **Hematocrit Independence**: Both methods were unaffected by hematocrit levels, which means that the accuracy of the measurements is consistent regardless of the hematocrit levels in the sample.
4. **Trend in Low Hematocrit Samples**: Although the difference between the two methods tended to be larger in low hematocrit samples, this trend was not statistically significant

<reasoning>Step-by-step reasoning combining question and context:

1. **Understanding Tacrolimus Monitoring**: Tacrolimus is crucial in organ transplantation due to its potent immunosuppressive properties, but it also poses significant toxic effects. Therefore, accurate therapeutic drug monitoring is necessary.

2. **Immunoassay Methods**: Two specific methods were compared: Affinity Column-Mediated Immunoassay (ACMIA) and Microparticle Enzyme Immunoassay (MEIA). These methods are used to measure blood tacrolimus concentrations.

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - The study found that tacrolimus concentrations measured by the ACMIA method closely correlated with those measured by the MEIA method (r = 0.84).
   - This strong correlation suggests that the two methods produce similar results, which is important for reliability and consistency in clinical practice.

4. **Bland-Altman Plot**:
   - The Bland-Altman plot showed no specific trends, indicating that the differences between the two methods did not systematically bias the results in any particular direction.
   - This suggests that while there may be some minor variations, the overall agreement

1. The question asks whether anorectal endosonography is valuable in diagnosing dyschesia.
2. The context provides information about a prospective study conducted on patients with a history of dyschesia and a control group of healthy subjects.
3. Anorectal endosonography was used to measure the dimensions of the anal sphincter and the m. puborectalis at rest, during voluntary squeezing, and during straining.
4. The study found that in patients with dyschesia, the anal sphincter became paradoxically shorter and/or thicker during straining in 85% of cases, compared to only 35% of controls.
5. Additionally, the m. puborectalis showed similar changes in 80% of patients versus 30% of controls.
6. These differences were statistically significant (p<0.01, chi-squared test).
7. The findings suggest that anorectal endosonography can detect abnormalities in the anal sphincter and m. puborectalis in patients with dyschesia that are not present in healthy controls.

<key_facts>
The study investigated the relationship between sublingual varices and the presence of hypertension. It included 431 dental patients who underwent digital photography for grading of sublingual varices and had their blood pressure measured both in the clinic and at home. The study found a significant association between sublingual varices and hypertension (OR = 2.25, p<0.002), with higher mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures observed in those with more severe sublingual varices. The positive predictive value of sublingual varices for hypertension was 0.5, and the negative predictive value was 0.80.
</key_facts>
<contradictions>
None identified.
</contradictions>
<relevance>
The study provides evidence linking sublingual varices to hypertension, which could be useful in clinical practice for identifying patients at risk for hypertension.

Answer: yes
Based on the study described in the context, there is evidence that a physician's specialty does influence the recording of medication history in patients' case notes. Different specialties had varying levels of documentation for different aspects of the medication history, indicating that specialty plays a significant role in this process. Therefore, the answer is yes. Answer: yes Answer: yes
