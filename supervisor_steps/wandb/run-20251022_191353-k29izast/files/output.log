<reasoning>Step-by-step reasoning combining question and context

1. **Identify the Methods**: The context mentions two immunoassay methods for measuring tacrolimus concentrations: Affinity Column-Mediated Immunoassay (ACMIA) and Microparticle Enzyme Immunoassay (MEIA).

2. **Data Collection**: A total of 154 blood samples from kidney or liver transplant recipients were analyzed using both methods. This suggests that the comparison is based on a significant sample size, which enhances the reliability of the findings.

3. **Correlation Analysis**: The correlation coefficient (r) between the concentrations measured by ACMIA and MEIA was found to be 0.84. A correlation coefficient close to 1 indicates a strong positive linear relationship between the two sets of measurements, suggesting that the ACMIA method is closely aligned with the MEIA method in terms of the tacrolimus concentrations it measures.

4. **Bland-Altman Plot Analysis**: The Bland-Altman plot did not show specific trends, indicating that there is no systematic bias between the two methods. The lack of specific trends supports the consistency of the results from both methods

<reasoning>Step-by-step reasoning combining question and context

1. The question asks if anorectal endosonography is valuable in diagnosing dyschesia.

2. The context provides information about a study that used anorectal endosonography to assess patients with a medical history of dyschesia.

3. The study involved comparing 20 patients with dyschesia to a control group of 20 healthy subjects.

4. Both groups had their anal sphincter and m. puborectalis dimensions measured at rest, during voluntary squeezing, and during straining.

5. The study found significant differences in the measurements of these structures between patients with dyschesia and the healthy control group.

6. Specifically, the study noted that:
   - 85% of patients had a paradoxical shortening/thickening of the anal sphincter during straining, while only 35% of controls did.
   - 80% of patients had a similar change in the m. puborectalis, while only 30% of controls did.
   - These changes were statistically significant (p<0.01).

7. The statistical significance indicates that

<reasoning>
To determine if anorectal endosonography is valuable in diagnosing dyschesia, we need to analyze the results of the study described in the context:

1. The study aimed to use anorectal endosonography to demonstrate dysfunction of the anal sphincter and/or the musculus puborectalis in patients with dyschesia.
2. The study included 20 consecutive patients with a history of dyschesia and a control group of 20 healthy subjects.
3. Anorectal endosonography measures the dimensions of the anal sphincter and the musculus puborectalis at rest and during voluntary squeezing and straining.
4. In patients with dyschesia, the anal sphincter became paradoxically shorter and/or thicker during straining in 85% of cases, compared to only 35% in the control group.
5. These changes in sphincter length were statistically significantly different (p<0.01) between patients and controls.
6. Similarly, the musculus puborectalis showed paradoxical shortening and/or thick

<reasoning>
To determine if the affinity column-mediated immunoassay (ACMIA) method is suitable as an alternative to the microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA) method for blood tacrolimus assay, we need to consider several key factors based on the provided context:

1. **Correlation Analysis**: The study found that tacrolimus concentrations measured by the ACMIA method closely correlated with those measured by the MEIA method (r = 0.84). This strong correlation suggests that the ACMIA method provides results that are highly consistent with the MEIA method, which is considered the gold standard.

2. **Bland-Altman Plot**: The Bland-Altman plot, which assesses agreement between the two methods, showed no specific trends. This indicates that the differences between the two methods are random rather than systematic, further supporting the reliability of the ACMIA method.

3. **Hematocrit Influence**: Both the MEIA and ACMIA methods were not affected by hematocrit levels. This is important because changes in hematocrit can significantly impact immunoassay results, making this

<problem>Is the affinity column-mediated immunoassay method suitable as an alternative to the microparticle enzyme immunoassay method as a blood tacrolimus assay?</problem>
<answer>Yes</answer>
<reasoning>Step-by-step reasoning combining question and context</reasoning>

<reasoning>Step-by-step reasoning combining question and context:

1. The study compared two immunoassay methods for measuring whole-blood tacrolimus concentrations: Affinity Column-Mediated Immunoassay (ACMIA) and Microparticle Enzyme Immunoassay (MEIA).

2. A total of 154 samples from kidney or liver transplant recipients were analyzed using both methods.

3. The correlation between the tacrolimus concentrations measured by ACMIA and MEIA was found to be strong, with a Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) of 0.84. This indicates a high level of agreement between the two methods.

4. The Bland-Altman plot, which assesses agreement between measurements by plotting the difference between the two methods against their mean, did not show any specific trends. This suggests that there was no consistent bias between the methods.
