Given the problem:
Does a physician's specialty influence the recording of medication history in patients' case notes?

Context:
To determine the impact of a physician's specialty on the frequency and depth of medication history documented in patient medical records. A cross-sectional assessment of the frequency and depth of medication history information documented by 123 physicians for 900 randomly selected patients stratified across Cardiology, Chest, Dermatology, Endocrine, Gastroenterology, Haematology, Neurology, Psychiatry and Renal specialties was carried out at a 900-bed teaching hospital located in Ibadan, Nigeria. Four hundred and forty-three (49.2%) of the cohort were males and 457 (50.8%) were females; with mean ages 43.2 +/- 18.6 and 43.1 +/- 17.9 years respectively. Physicians' specialties significantly influenced the depth of documentation of the medication history information across the nine specialties (P<0.0001). Post hoc pair-wise comparisons with Tukey's HSD test showed that the mean scores for adverse drug reactions and adherence to medicines was highest in the Cardiology specialty; while the Chest specialty had the highest mean scores for allergy to drugs, food, chemicals and cigarette smoking. Mean scores for the use of alcohol; illicit drugs; dietary restrictions was highest for Gastroenterology, Psychiatry and Endocrine specialties respectively. Physicians' specialties also significantly influenced the frequency of documentation of the medication history across the nine specialties (P<0.0001).

<reasoning>
Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The study assesses how different physician specialties affect the documentation of medication history in patient records.
2. It evaluates both the frequency and depth of this documentation.
3. The data is collected from 123 physicians across 9 specialties at a 900-bed teaching hospital in Ibadan, Nigeria.
4. The study includes a total of 900 randomly selected patients.
5. The analysis shows significant differences in documentation practices across specialties (P<0.0001).
6. Post-hoc comparisons reveal specific areas where each specialty excels:
   - Cardiology has the highest scores for adverse drug reactions and adherence to medicines.
   - Chest specialty has the highest scores for allergies to various substances.
   - Gastroenterology has the highest scores for documenting alcohol use.
   - Psychiatry has the highest scores for documenting illicit drug use.
   - Endocrine specialty has the highest scores for documenting dietary restrictions.
7. These findings indicate that different specialties focus more heavily on certain aspects of medication history based on their clinical practice requirements and patient populations.

Conclusion: Yes, a physician's specialty does influence the recording of medication

Given the problem:
Is there a connection between sublingual varices and hypertension?

Context:
Sublingual varices have earlier been related to ageing, smoking and cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to investigate whether sublingual varices are related to presence of hypertension. In an observational clinical study among 431 dental patients tongue status and blood pressure were documented. Digital photographs of the lateral borders of the tongue for grading of sublingual varices were taken, and blood pressure was measured. Those patients without previous diagnosis of hypertension and with a noted blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and/or ≥ 90 mmHg at the dental clinic performed complementary home blood pressure during one week. Those with an average home blood pressure ≥ 135 mmHg and/or ≥ 85 mmHg were referred to the primary health care centre, where three office blood pressure measurements were taken with one week intervals. Two independent blinded observers studied the photographs of the tongues. Each photograph was graded as none/few (grade 0) or medium/severe (grade 1) presence of sublingual varices. Pearson's Chi-square test, Student's t-test, and multiple regression analysis were applied. Power calculation stipulated a study population of 323 patients. An association between sublingual varices and hypertension was found (OR = 2.25, p<0.002). Mean systolic blood pressure was 123 and 132 mmHg in patients with grade 0 and grade 1 sublingual varices, respectively (p<0.0001, CI 95 %). Mean diastolic blood pressure was 80 and 83 mmHg in patients with grade 0 and grade 1 sublingual varices, respectively (p<0.005, CI 95 %). Sublingual varices indicate hypertension with a positive predictive value of 0.5 and a negative predictive value of 0.80.

Answer: yes/maybe

Based on the information provided, there is a clear indication of an association between sublingual varices and hypertension. Therefore, the correct answer is "yes." However, without additional context or specific instructions, I will stick to the given format.

<answer>yes</answer>
Answer: yes/maybe

Given the format requirement, the answer must be "yes," but the nature of the question could warrant a "maybe" due to the need for further clarification or context. Since the instruction specifies to use "maybe" only when it's necessary, and the provided information is sufficient to conclude there is a connection, the answer remains:

<answer>yes</answer>
Answer: yes/maybe

Answer: yes

The correct answer format based on the given instructions is <answer>yes</answer>, which corresponds to "yes" in the final answer. Given the context and the need to strictly follow the format, "maybe" is not applicable here. Therefore, the final answer is:

Given the problem:
Is the affinity column-mediated immunoassay method suitable as an alternative to the microparticle enzyme immunoassay method as a blood tacrolimus assay?

Context:
Tacrolimus is a potent immunosuppressive drug used in organ transplantation. Because of its substantial toxic effects, narrow therapeutic index, and interindividual pharmacokinetic variability, therapeutic drug monitoring of whole-blood tacrolimus concentrations has been recommended. We investigated the comparability of the results of 2 immunoassay systems, affinity column-mediated immunoassay (ACMIA) and microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA), comparing differences in the tacrolimus concentrations measured by the 2 methods in relation to the hematologic and biochemical values of hepatic and renal functions. A total of 154 samples from kidney or liver transplant recipients were subjected to Dimension RxL HM with a tacrolimus Flex reagent cartilage for the ACMIA method and IMx tacrolimus II for the MEIA method. Tacrolimus concentrations measured by the ACMIA method (n = 154) closely correlated with those measured by the MEIA method (r = 0.84). The Bland-Altman plot using concentration differences between the 2 methods and the average of the 2 methods showed no specific trends. The tacrolimus levels determined by both the MEIA method and the ACMIA method were not influenced by hematocrit levels, but the difference between the 2 methods (ACMIA - MEIA) tended to be larger in low hematocrit samples (P<.001).
